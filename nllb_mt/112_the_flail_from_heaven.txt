It's called once a farmer with a pair of eyes to the plow.. When he came to the field, he found the two animals with horns and grew strong, and when he went home, they were so big that he could not go in with them.. "To their good fortune, a butcher came to them, and they let him have it, and they concluded the deal, that he should bring the butcher a measure of rhubarb, and then for every grain a bragging thaler".. The farmer comes home with the measure of grain on his back, but on the way he loses a grain from the sack.. The butcher paid him as he had done right; had the farmer not lost the corn, he would have had a braver thaler.. But then, as he returned from the journey, a tree grew from the corn and reached heaven.. The farmer thought, "While the opportunity is there, you must see what the angels are doing below, and look them in the eye once more". He also climbed up and saw that the angels above were moving and looked at the tree; as he looked, he noticed that the tree on which he stood, unable to move, looked down and saw that it was just one of them. "If you had fallen from the heavens, it would have been a bad thing", he thought, "and in the night he knew no better way to help himself than to take the oats from the field, and put them in the heap, and draw a rope from it, and then take a hawk and a threshing-floor, and put them in the heavens, and let himself down in the sea".. He came down to earth just in a deep deep lake, and it was a real luck that he had the hack, because he hacked himself with a ladder, climbed up in the height and brought the Dreschflegel zum Wahrzeichen mit, so that nobody could doubt his story anymore.
