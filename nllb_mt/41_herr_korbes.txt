It was once a hen and a chicken, who wanted to make a journey together. They built a beautiful carriage, had four wheels, and four horses.. The Hohens set themselves with the Hohens auf and they went with each other to the fort. Not long after, I met a cat, who said, "Where do you want to go?" The cat answered, "Go out after the Lord's basket to his house".. The answer is simple: "Sit down, so that you don't fall off before you get off the wagon". "Take care that you don't make my wheels dirty". "Ride, sweep, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle,. The House of Korbes is not to be disturbed.. The girls drove the carriage into the barn, the chickens flew with the chickens on a pole, the cat sat in the fireplace, the duck in the barn, the egg wrapped itself in a towel, the needle stuck into the pillow, the needle jumped on the bed in the pillow, and the millstone sat on the door.. When the Lord came to the house, he came to the fireplace and wanted to light a fire, so he put a cat in the fireplace with his face full of ashes.. He loved to wind in the kitchen and wanted to wash, so he sprayed him with water in the face.. He wanted to get the towel off, but the man rolled up against him, slit his throat and glued his eyes shut.. He wanted to rest, and sat down on the chair, and stabbed him to death.. He grew angry and threw himself on the bed, and, as he layed his head on the pillow, he stabbed him in the neck, so that he wanted to write and walk in the wide world.. When he came to the house, he jumped down the MÃ¼hlstein and beat him to death.. The Herr Korbes must have been a very bad man.
