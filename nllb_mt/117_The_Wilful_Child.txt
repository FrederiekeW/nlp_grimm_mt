It was once a kind of own meaning and that was not what his mother wanted. Darum had der liebe Gott kein Wohlfallen an ihm und let es krank werden, und kein Arzt konnte ihm helfen, und in kurzem lag es auf dem Todtenbettchen He had the love of God and God had not been pleased with him and had not allowed him to become sick, and no doctor could have helped him, and in short he was on his deathbed. When he is now in the grave and the earth is covered with war, his arms will once again rise and reach the heights, and when he is placed in the fresh earth above it, his arms will never again be out.. And the mother went down to the pit, and Ruth with her, and she went in, and the child rested in the midst of the earth.
