A brother and a sister were playing in a fountain, and as they played, they both plunged into it.. I've already told you, now you must work hard, and lead with your fort. The girl had to spin a confounded piece of flax, and had to carry water in a hole, but the boy had to carry a tree with a blunt axe, and had nothing to eat, and had to be a hard stone.. The children were so impatient that they waited until one Sunday, when the Nixe in der Kirche war, they fled.. And when the Church had passed the war, the Nixes saw that the birds had flown out, and set them with great springs after. The children looked at her from afar, and the girl saw behind her a large mountain of brushes, with a thousand and a thousand stakes, over which Nix had to climb with great difficulty; but at last she came over it.. As the children saw, the boy had a cam behind him, a large cam with a thousand thousand pieces of zinc, but Nix knew how to keep it together and came over. The girl's face was a mirror backwards, which gave a mirror to the mountain, the face so smooth, so smooth, that she could not possibly cross it.. I thought I'd go home and get my axe and go to Spiegelberg. But when I got back, and the glass was up, the children had already run away, and Wassernixe had to go back to her fountain.
