Once upon a time, a stone-aged man had his eyes darkened, his ears dull, and his knees trembled.. If he could sit at the table and hold the spoon, he would put the soup on the table and then he would have something to eat.. His son and his wife were waiting for him, and so the old grandfather had to sit down at last behind the stove in the corner, and they gave him his food in an iron bowl, and not once did he get enough; for he was sad after the table, and his eyes were naked. Once again, his trembling hands could not hold the dishes, he was faithful to the earth and to the bread. The young woman said, he said but nothing and only. I bought him a glass of Schüsselchen for a few Hellers, so I had to eat it now. We're sitting here, so the little boy of four years on the ground is sitting with the little boy.. What are you doing?. "I make a Tröglein", replied the child, "so that father and mother eat when I grow up". After a while, the man and woman saw each other, finally came to cry, and they also brought the old grandfather to the table and let him eat with me forever, and said nothing when he spilled a little.
