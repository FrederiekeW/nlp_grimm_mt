One afternoon the Christ child had laid himself in his Wiegenbett and was asleep, and his mother was amazed, and saw him full of joy and said, "Have you slept, my child? Sleep well, I will go in the forest and get a handful of strawberries for you; I know well, you will be happy about it, when you wake up".. They're scared, they're leaving the beer standing and they're going away. The Nightingale shoots her after, but the Mother of God, you can think, knows good Rath, she hides behind a Haselstaude and remains standing, till the Nightingale has again crawled. She then collects the Beeren, and as she makes her way home, she speaks "How the Haselstaude has been my protection this time, so shall it also be in the future of other people".
