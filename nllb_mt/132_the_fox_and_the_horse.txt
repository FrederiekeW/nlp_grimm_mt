There was a farmer who had a faithful horse, which was old and could no longer do any service, and wanted to be his master, but he could not give him any food, and said, "I can't use you anymore, but I'm good with you, if you're not so strong that you bring me a lion here, I'll keep you, but now I'll make you stronger from my stable, and I'll hunt you in the field".. The horse was sad and went to the forest to find a little shelter from the weather.. When I met him, the fox said, "Why do you hang your head and go alone?" The horse answered, "Geiz and Treue don't live together in the same house. My master has forgotten what I have done for him for so many years, and because I can't eat any more, he will not give me any more food, and he has chased me away"..  Der Trost was schlecht, er hat gesagt wenn ich noch so stark wäre, daß ich ihm einen Löwen brächte, wollte er mich behalten, aber er weiß wohl, dass ich das nicht vermag.  Der Fuchs sprach da will ich dir helfen, leg dich nur hin, strecke dich aus und rege dich nicht, als wärst du tot.  Das Pferd, das war der Fuchs verlangte, der Fuchs aber gieng zum Löwen, der seine Höhle nicht weit davon hatte und sprach da draußen liegt ein tottes Pferd, komm doch mit hinaus, da kannst du eine fette Mahlzeit halten.  Der. The foxes but banded with the horses, the lions with their legs, and drew and laced everything so well and strong, that it was with no strength to break the war. When he had finished his work, he slapped the horse on the shoulder and said, "Zieh, Schimmel, zieh".. The lion was afraid to roar, so that the birds in the whole forest flew away in fright, but the horse let him roar, dragged and dragged him across the field before his lord Thür. As the Lord saw it, he prayed for a better horse, and said to the horse, "Stay with me, and it will be well with you".
