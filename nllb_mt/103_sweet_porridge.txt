Once upon a time there was a poor girl who lived alone with her mother and had nothing to eat.. When the child went out into the forest, and met him there an old woman, who knew his sorrow already and gave him a Töpfchen, to them should be said Töpfchen, koche, so kochte es guten süßen Hirsenbrei, and when it said Töpfchen, steh, so hörte es wieder auf zu kochen. The maiden brought the pot to her mother's house, and now she was free from her poverty and hunger and ate sweet bread as often as she wanted.. Once upon a time, when the girl went out, her mother said, "Töpfchen, koche,  da kocht es", and she was satisfied; now she wants the topping to stop, but she doesn't know the word.. And the kitchen is full, and the second house, and then the street, as if the whole world were sat, and the greatest thing, and no one knows how to help themselves.. Finally, as only one house remained, the child came home, and only spoke "Töpfchen", "Steh", "Steh" and listened to cooking; and whoever wanted to go back to the city had to eat.
