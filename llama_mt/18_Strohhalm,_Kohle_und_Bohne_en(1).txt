In a village lived a poor old woman, who had brought together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. She made a fire on her hearth, and in order to make it burn faster, she lit it with a handful of straw. When she poured the beans into the pot, one of them fell unnoticed to the ground beside a straw. Shortly afterwards, a glowing coal jumped from the hearth down to the two. The straw began to speak and said, "Dear friends, where do you come from?" The coal replied, "I have escaped from the fire by good luck, and if I hadn't forced my way out, I would certainly have been dead: I would have been reduced to ashes." The bean said, "I have also escaped with my skin intact, but if the old woman had put me in the pot, I would have been mercilessly cooked into a pulp, like my companions." "Would I have been any luckier?" said the straw, "the old woman has set all my brothers on fire and reduced them to ashes. She packed sixty of them at once and killed them. Fortunately, I slipped through her fingers." "But what shall we do now?" said the coal. "I think," replied the bean, "since we have escaped the death so fortunate, we shall stick together as good companions and, so that we do not meet a new misfortune here, we shall emigrate and move to a foreign land together."

The proposal pleased the other two, and they set off together. But soon they came to a small brook, and as there was no bridge or stepping stone, they did not know how to get across. The straw found a good solution and said, "I will lie across, so you can walk across on me like a bridge." The straw stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal, which was hot-natured, stepped boldly onto the newly built bridge. But when it had reached the middle and heard the water rushing beneath it, it became afraid: it stopped and did not dare to go further. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in two, and fell into the brook: the coal slipped after it, hissed as it hit the water, and gave up the ghost. The bean, which had prudently remained on the bank, had to laugh at the story and could not stop; it laughed so loudly that it burst. Now it was also its turn to meet its end, if not for the good luck that a tailor, who was on a journey, had taken a rest by the brook. Since he had a compassionate heart, he took out needle and thread and sewed it together. The bean thanked him in the most beautiful way, but since he used black thread, all beans have had a black seam ever since.
