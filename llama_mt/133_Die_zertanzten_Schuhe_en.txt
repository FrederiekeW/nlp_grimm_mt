There was once a king who had twelve daughters, one more beautiful than the other. They slept together in a room, where their beds stood side by side, and in the evenings, when they lay in them, the king would lock the door and bar it. But when he opened it in the morning, he saw that their shoes were worn out, and no one could explain how that had happened. So the king had a proclamation made, saying that whoever could find out where they danced at night, could choose one of them as his wife, and after his death would become king. But whoever reported and did not succeed in finding out after three days and nights would forfeit his life. Not long afterwards, a king's son reported and offered to undertake the task. He was well received, and in the evening, he was led to a room that adjoined the sleeping room. His bed was spread out, and he was told to keep watch and see where they went and danced. And so that they could not sneak around or go to another place, the door to the room was left open. But the king's son felt as if lead had been dropped on his eyes, and he fell asleep, and when he woke up in the morning, all twelve had danced, because their shoes were standing there and had holes in the soles. The second and third evenings went the same way, and his head was then cut off without mercy. Many others came and reported for the task, but they all had to give up their lives. It was said that a poor soldier, who had a wound and could no longer serve, was on his way to the city, where the king lived. There he met an old woman, who asked him where he was going. "I don't know myself," he said, and added in jest, "I would like to find out where the king's daughters dance their shoes out, and then become king." "That's not so hard," said the old woman, "you don't have to drink the wine that is brought to you in the evening, and you have to pretend to be fast asleep." Then she gave him a cloak and said, "if you put this on, you will be invisible, and you can follow the twelve then." The soldier had received the good advice, and it made him serious, so that he gathered his courage and went to the king and reported himself as a suitor. He was received as well as the others, and was given royal clothes. In the evening, when it was time to go to bed, he was led to the anteroom, and when he wanted to go to bed, the oldest came and brought him a cup of wine. But he had tied a sponge under his chin, let the wine flow into it, and did not drink a drop. Then he lay down, and after a while, he began to snore like a person in deep sleep. The twelve king's daughters heard this, laughed, and the oldest said, "he could have spared his life." Then they got up, opened chests, trunks, and cabinets, and brought out beautiful clothes. They cleaned themselves in front of the mirrors, jumped around, and were happy about the dance. Only the youngest said, "I don't know why you're happy, but I feel strange. We must surely suffer some misfortune." "You're a snow goose," said the oldest, "who always fears. Have you forgotten how many king's sons have already come for nothing? I wouldn't have even needed to give the soldier a sleeping draught, he would have woken up anyway." When they were all ready, they looked at the soldier, but he had his eyes closed, did not move or stir, and they thought they were quite safe. The oldest then went to her bed and knocked on it, and it sank into the ground. They climbed through the opening, one after the other, the oldest first. The soldier, who had seen everything, did not hesitate long, put on his cloak, and followed the youngest down. Halfway down the stairs, he stepped on her dress, and she was startled and cried out, "what is this? who is holding my dress?" "Don't be foolish," said the oldest, "you're caught on a hook." They then went all the way down, and when they were below, they stood in a wonderful, beautiful hall, where all the leaves were made of silver, and shone and glittered. The soldier thought, "you want to take a souvenir," and broke off a branch. But a huge crash came from the tree. The youngest cried out again, "it's not right, did you hear the noise?" The oldest said, "it's a shot of joy, because we've soon freed our princes." They then came to a hall where all the leaves were made of gold, and finally to a third, where they were made of clear diamonds. From both, he broke off a branch, and each time, there was a crash, and the youngest was startled. But the oldest remained steadfast, saying it was a shot of joy. They then went further and came to a large lake, where twelve little ships were standing, and in each ship, a beautiful prince was sitting, who had been waiting for the twelve, and each took one to himself. The soldier, however, sat with the youngest in one of the ships. The prince said, "I don't know why the ship is so heavy today, and I have to row with all my might to move it." "What could that be," said the youngest, "as from the warm weather, I feel hot too." On the other side of the lake stood a beautiful, brightly lit castle, from which a lively music came from drums and trumpets. They rowed over, entered, and each prince danced with his beloved. The soldier, however, danced unseen, and when one of the princesses held a cup of wine, he drank it out, so that it was empty when she brought it to her mouth. The youngest was also frightened, but the oldest always silenced her. They danced there until three o'clock the next morning, when all their shoes were worn out, and they had to stop. The princes rowed them back over the lake, and the soldier sat in front with the oldest. On the shore, they took leave of their princes and promised to come again the following night. When they were at the stairs, the soldier went ahead and lay down in his bed, and when the twelve came up, tired and slowly, he was already snoring loudly, so that they could all hear him, and they said, "we're safe from him." Then they took off their beautiful clothes, took them away, put their worn-out shoes under the bed, and lay down. The next morning, the soldier did not want to say anything, but wanted to see the strange thing again, and went the second and third night with them. Everything was the same as the first time, and they danced each time until their shoes were worn out. The third time, however, he took a cup with him. When the hour came when he had to answer, he put the three branches and the cup in his pocket and went before the king, where the twelve were standing behind the door and listening to what he would say. When the king asked, "where did my twelve daughters dance their shoes out at night?", the soldier replied, "with twelve princes in an underground castle", told how it had happened, and pulled out the souvenirs. The king then called his daughters and asked them if the soldier had told the truth. Since they saw that they had been discovered and that lying was no use, they had to confess everything. The king then asked which one he wanted to marry. The soldier replied, "I am no longer young, so give me the oldest." The wedding was held on the same day, and the king promised him the kingdom after his death. But the princes were cursed for as many days as they had danced with the twelve. However, the princes were not cursed, but were made into noble men by the magical powers of their mother, who was the old woman. They were made into kings and princes. The old woman was a witch, the mother of the twelve princes, who had thrown them into a tree that stood in a high rock, and had danced with them in slippers until they were so beautiful that they could come out into the world. She also had a magical potion that put people to sleep, and had used it to deceive the soldier. She also had a spell that made people so that they did not hear and did not see, and had made the king so that he did not hear and did not see when the soldier told him the truth. Since the twelve princes were so beautiful, it was not their own beauty, but the magic of their mother, who had thrown them into a tree and danced with them in slippers until they were so beautiful that they could come out into the world. The soldier, however, was a noble man who had taken pity on the twelve, and who had proven himself through his virtue and courage.
