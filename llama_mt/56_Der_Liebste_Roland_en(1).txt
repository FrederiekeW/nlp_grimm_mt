Once upon a time, there was a woman who was a right witch, and she had two daughters, one ugly and wicked, and the other beautiful and good. The ugly and wicked one loved her mother, because she was her own daughter, and the beautiful and good one hated her, because she was her stepdaughter. At one time, the stepdaughter had a beautiful apron, which the other daughter envied, so that she became jealous and told her mother that she wanted and needed the apron. ‘Be still, my child,’ said the old woman, ‘you shall have it. Your stepsister has long deserved death, tonight when she sleeps, I will come and knock her head off. Just make sure you get into bed behind her, and push her forward.’ But the poor girl had overheard everything, and if she hadn’t been standing in a corner, it would have happened to her. She was not allowed to go out the door all day, and when bedtime came, she had to get into bed first, so that the old woman could get into bed behind her. But when the old woman had gone to sleep, the girl gently pushed her forward and took her place behind the wall. In the night, the old woman came creeping, with an axe in her right hand, and with her left hand felt if anyone was lying forward. Then she took the axe with both hands, and struck and struck her own child’s head off.

When the old woman had gone, the girl got up and went to her beloved, whose name was Roland, and knocked on his door. When he came out, she said to him, ‘Listen, dear Roland, we must flee quickly, my stepmother wanted to kill me, but she hit her own child instead. When the day comes, and she sees what she has done, we will be lost.’ ‘But I advise you,’ said Roland, ‘to take the magic staff first, otherwise we can’t escape if she chases and pursues us.’ The girl fetched the magic staff, and then took the dead head and dripped three drops of blood on the ground, one in front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then they hurried off together.

When the old woman got up in the morning, she called out to her daughter, and wanted to give her the apron, but she didn’t come. Then she called out, ‘Where are you?’ ‘Ah, I’m on the stairs, I’m coming,’ replied the first drop of blood. The old woman went outside, but didn’t see anyone on the stairs, and called out again, ‘Where are you?’ ‘Ah, I’m in the kitchen, I’m warming myself up,’ replied the second drop of blood. She went into the kitchen, but didn’t find anyone. Then she called out again, ‘Where are you?’ ‘Ah, I’m in bed, I’m sleeping,’ replied the third drop of blood. She went into the bedroom, and what did she see? Her own child, swimming in its own blood, and which she had struck the head off herself.

The old woman was enraged, leapt to the window, and since she could see far into the world, she spotted her stepdaughter and her beloved Roland fleeing away. ‘That won’t help you,’ she cried, ‘even if you’re far away, you won’t escape me.’ She put on her magic shoes, which made her take a step an hour, and it didn’t take long before she had caught up with them. But the girl, when she saw the old woman approaching, transformed Roland into a lake with her magic staff, and herself into a duck, which was swimming in the middle of the lake. The old woman stood on the shore, threw bread into the lake, and tried to lure the duck out, but it wouldn’t come. In the evening, the old woman had to return home without achieving anything.

Then the girl and her beloved Roland took back their natural form, and they continued their journey all night until dawn. When the girl transformed into a beautiful flower, which was standing in the middle of a thorn hedge, and Roland into a musician, the old woman approached and said to the musician, ‘Dear musician, may I pluck the beautiful flower?’ ‘Oh yes,’ replied he, ‘I’ll play for it.’ When the old woman quickly crawled into the hedge and tried to pluck the flower, the musician started playing, and, whether she wanted to or not, she had to dance, because it was a magic dance. The faster he played, the more violent her leaps became, and the thorns tore her clothes off, stung her and wounded her. And since he didn’t stop playing, she had to dance until she lay dead.

When they were finally free, Roland said, ‘Now I want to go to my father and arrange the wedding.’ ‘So I will stay here,’ said the girl, ‘and wait for you, and so that no one recognizes me, I will transform into a red stone.’ Then Roland went off, and the girl stood as a red stone on the field, waiting for her beloved. But Roland forgot her and got caught up in another affair, which led him to forget the girl. The poor girl stood for a long time, and when Roland didn’t come back at all, she became sad and transformed into a flower, thinking that she would be trampled on by someone.

But it happened that a shepherd was guarding his sheep on the field and saw the flower. Because it was so beautiful, he picked it, took it with him, and put it in his chest.

From that time on, strange things happened in the shepherd’s house. When he got up in the morning, all the work was already done: the room was tidy, the table and benches were polished, the fire was lit, and the water was carried. And when he came home for lunch, the table was set, and a good meal was prepared. He couldn’t understand how it happened, because he never saw a person in his house, and it was impossible for someone to be hiding in the small cottage. The good service pleased him, but eventually he became frightened, so he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise woman said, ‘There is magic at work here; one morning, at the break of dawn, look carefully to see if anything moves in the room, and if you see anything, no matter what it is, quickly throw a white cloth over it, and the magic will be broken.’ The shepherd did as she said, and the next morning, just as the day was breaking, he saw the chest opening and the flower coming out. Quickly, he jumped up and threw a white cloth over it. Immediately, the transformation was over, and a beautiful girl stood before him, telling him that she was the flower, and had been taking care of his household. She told him her story, and because he liked her, he asked if she would marry him. But she replied, ‘No,’ because she wanted to remain true to her beloved Roland, although he had left her. However, she promised that she would not leave him, but would continue to take care of his household.

When the time came for Roland to get married, the custom in the land was to announce it to all the girls, so that they could sing in honor of the bride and groom. The faithful girl, when she heard about it, became so sad that she thought her heart would burst, and she didn’t want to go. But the others came and fetched her. When it was her turn to sing, she stepped back, but since she was the only one left, she couldn’t avoid it. But when she began to sing, and her voice reached Roland’s ears, he sprang up and cried, ‘I recognize the voice, that’s the right bride, I don’t want any other.’ Everything he had forgotten and had forgotten about her came back to his heart. Then the faithful girl got married to her beloved Roland, and her suffering came to an end, and her joy began. And so she became Roland’s wife, and the poor girl, who had transformed into a flower, a duck, and finally a red stone, finally found happiness and lived in peace with her beloved Roland.
