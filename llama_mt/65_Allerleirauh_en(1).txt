Once upon a time there was a king who had a wife with golden hair, and she was so beautiful that her equal could not be found on earth. It happened that she fell ill and, when she felt that she would soon die, she called the king and said, “If you want to remarry after my death, you must not take a woman who is not as beautiful as I am, and who does not have such golden hair as I have. You must promise me this.” After the king had promised her this, she closed her eyes and died.

The king was not consoled for a long time and did not think of remarrying. Finally, his counselors said, “It cannot be otherwise, the king must remarry so that we have a queen.” Now, messengers were sent far and wide to find a bride who was as beautiful as the deceased queen. But there was none in the whole world, and even if one had been found, there was none who had such golden hair. So the messengers returned home without success.

The king had a daughter who was as beautiful as her deceased mother and had the same golden hair. When she grew up, the king saw her and saw that she was like her deceased wife in everything, and he suddenly felt a strong love for her. Then he said to his counselors, “I want to marry my daughter, because she is the image of my deceased wife, and I will not find another bride who is like her.” When the counselors heard this, they were shocked and said, “God has forbidden that a father should marry his daughter, for from sin nothing good can come, and the kingdom will be led to ruin.” The daughter was more shocked than she heard her father’s decision, but she hoped to dissuade him from his intention. So she said to him, “Before I fulfill your wish, I must have three dresses, one as golden as the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars; further, I demand a cloak made of a thousand different furs and rough skins, and each animal in your kingdom must give a piece of its skin for it.” But she thought to herself, “This is completely impossible, and I will thus dissuade my father from his bad thoughts.” The king did not give up, and the most skilled girls in his kingdom had to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars; and his hunters had to catch all the animals in the whole kingdom and take a piece of their skin. From this, a cloak made of a thousand different furs and rough skins was made. Finally, when everything was ready, the king had the cloak brought to him, spread it out before her, and said, “Tomorrow there will be a wedding.”

Now, the king’s daughter saw that there was no hope of changing her father’s heart, so she decided to escape. One night, when everyone was asleep, she got up and took three valuable items from her belongings, a golden ring, a golden spinning wheel, and a golden spindle. She put the three dresses in a nut shell, put on the cloak made of a thousand different furs and rough skins, and made her face and hands black with soot. Then she called upon God and went out, and went all night until she came to a large forest. And because she was tired, she sat down in a hollow tree and fell asleep.

The sun rose and she slept on, and slept still when it was already high noon. Then it happened that the king, who owned this forest, was hunting there. When his dogs came to the tree, they sniffed, ran around, and barked. The king said to the hunters, “Look, what wild animal is hiding there.” The hunters followed the command, and when they returned, they said, “In the hollow tree there is a wondrous animal, which we have never seen before: its skin has a thousand different furs; but it lies and sleeps.” The king said, “See if you can catch it alive, then tie it up on the wagon and take it with you.” When the hunters touched the girl, she woke up with a fright and called out to them, “I am a poor child, abandoned by father and mother, have mercy on me and take me with you.” The hunters said, “Allerleirauh, you are good for the kitchen, come along, you can sweep the ashes.” So they put her on the wagon and drove her back to the royal palace. There, they showed her a small stall under the stairs, where no daylight came, and said, “Rauhthierchen, you can live there and sleep.” Then they sent her to the kitchen, where she had to carry wood and water, kindle the fire, pluck the fowl, prepare the vegetables, sweep the ashes, and do all the dirty work.

Allerleirauh lived for a long time in poverty. Oh, beautiful king’s daughter, how will it go with you! But one day, a festival was held in the palace, and she said to the cook, “May I go up and watch? I want to stand outside the door.” The cook replied, “Yes, go ahead, but in half an hour you must be back and sweep the ashes.” So she took her oil lamp, went to her stall, took off the fur cloak, washed her face and hands clean, and her golden hair shone through. Then she took the nut shell and got out the dress that shone like the sun. And when this was done, she went up to the festival, and everyone stepped aside for her, for no one knew her, and they thought she was a king’s daughter. The king came up to her, took her hand, and danced with her, and thought in his heart, “I have never seen anyone as beautiful as this.” When the dance was over, she curtsied, and when the king looked around, she had disappeared, and no one knew where she had gone. The guards who stood at the palace gate were called and questioned, but no one had seen her.

But she had run to her stall, quickly taken off her dress, made her face and hands black again, and put on the fur cloak. When she came into the kitchen, she wanted to go back to work and sweep the ashes, but the cook said, “Leave it alone until tomorrow and cook me a soup for the king, I want to go up and watch too: but don’t let a single hair fall in, or you will never get anything to eat again.” So the cook went away, and Allerleirauh cooked the soup for the king, and cooked a bread soup as well as she could, and when it was ready, she took the golden ring from her stall and put it in the bowl. When the king had finished eating, he called the cook and asked him who had cooked the soup. The cook replied, “I cooked it.” But the king said, “That is not true, for it was cooked in a way that I have never tasted before.” The cook replied, “I must confess that I did not cook it, but the Rauhthierchen did.” The king said, “Go and bring it here.”

When Allerleirauh came, the king asked her, “Who are you?” “I am a poor child who has no father or mother left,” she replied. The king asked further, “What are you doing in my palace?” “I am good for nothing but to have my shoes thrown at my head,” she replied. The king asked further, “Where did you get the ring that was in the soup?” “I know nothing about the ring,” she replied. So the king could not find out anything and had to send her away again.

Over time, another festival was held, and Allerleirauh asked the cook, just like before, to be allowed to go up and watch. The cook replied, “Yes, but come back in half an hour and cook the bread soup for the king, he likes it very much.” So she ran to her stall, quickly washed her face and hands, and took out the dress that shone like the moon. She put it on and went up to the festival, and looked like a king’s daughter. The king came up to her and was happy to see her again, and because the dance was about to start, they danced together. When the dance was over, she disappeared again so quickly that the king could not see where she went. She ran to her stall, took off the dress, made her face and hands black again, and put on the fur cloak. Then she went to the kitchen, cooked the bread soup, and put the golden spinning wheel in the bowl. The king ate the soup and thought it was as good as the previous one, and he called the cook and asked him who had cooked the soup. The cook had to confess that it was Allerleirauh who had cooked it. Allerleirauh came before the king again, but she replied that she was only good for having her shoes thrown at her head, and that she knew nothing about the golden spinning wheel.

When the king held his third festival, it went the same way as the previous ones. The cook said, “You are a witch, Rauhthierchen, and you always put something in the soup that makes it taste so good and better than what I cook.” But he let her go, just like before. Now she put on the dress that shone like the stars, and went up to the festival. The king danced with her again and thought she was as beautiful as he had never seen before. And while they danced, he secretly put a golden ring on her finger, and ordered the dance to last a long time. When the dance was over, he wanted to hold her hands, but she pulled away and ran so quickly under the people that she disappeared from his sight. She ran to her stall, but because she had stayed too long and over half an hour, she could not take off the dress, but only threw the fur cloak over it, and in her haste, she did not make her face and hands completely black, but one finger remained white. Allerleirauh went to the kitchen, cooked the bread soup, and put the golden spindle in the bowl. The king found the spindle on the bottom of the bowl and called Allerleirauh, and saw the white finger and the ring that he had put on her finger during the dance. He took her hand and held her fast, and when she tried to pull away and run, the fur cloak opened a little, and the starry dress shone through. The king grabbed the cloak and tore it off. Then her golden hair shone through, and she stood there in all her beauty and could no longer hide. And when she washed the soot and ashes from her face, she was more beautiful than anyone has ever seen on earth. The king said, “You are my beloved bride, and we will never part from each other again.” And so their wedding was celebrated, and they lived happily until their death.
