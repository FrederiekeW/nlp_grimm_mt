A cat had become acquainted with a mouse and had told her so much about the great love and friendship she bore her that the mouse finally agreed to live with her in a house and conduct a joint household. ‘But for the winter, we must make provision, otherwise we shall suffer hunger,’ said the cat, ‘you little mouse, you can’t climb everywhere and you may end up in a trap.’ The good advice was therefore followed and a pot of fat was purchased. They did not know where they should put it, finally, after much deliberation, the cat said ‘I know no place where it would be better kept than the church, where no one dares to take anything away: we will put it under the altar and will not touch it until we need it.’ The pot was therefore safely stored, but it did not take long for the cat to develop a craving for it and to say to the mouse ‘what I wanted to tell you, little mouse, I have been asked to be godmother by my aunt: she has given birth to a little boy with brown spots, and I am to be his godmother. Let me go out today and you take care of the house alone.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ replied the mouse, ‘go in God’s name, if you eat something good, think of me: I would also like to drink a drop of the sweet red child’s porridge wine.’ But it was all untrue, the cat had no aunt, and was not asked to be godmother. She went straight to the church, crept up to the pot of fat, began to lick it, and licked the fatty skin off. Then she took a stroll on the rooftops of the town, took a look at the opportunity, stretched out in the sun, and wiped her whiskers as often as she thought of the pot of fat. Only in the evening did she return home. ‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘you must have had a fun day.’ ‘It went well enough,’ replied the cat. ‘What did the child get named?’ asked the mouse. ‘Hautab’ said the cat quite dryly. ‘Hautab!’ cried the mouse, ‘that is a very strange and peculiar name, is it a name that is used in your family?’ ‘What is there more to it?’ said the cat, ‘it is not worse than Bröseldieb, like your relatives are called.’ Not long after, the cat again developed a craving. She said to the mouse ‘you must do me a favour and take care of the household again, I have been asked to be godmother for the second time, and since the child has a white ring around its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse agreed, but the cat slipped behind the city wall to the church and ate half of the pot of fat. ‘There is nothing better to eat than what one eats oneself,’ she said, and was completely satisfied with her day’s work. When she came home, the mouse asked ‘what was the child baptized with?’ ‘Halbaus’ replied the cat. ‘Halbaus! what you say! I have never heard of that name in my life, I bet it is not in the calendar.’ The cat’s mouth began to water again for the tasty treat. ‘All good things come in threes,’ she said to the mouse, ‘so I should be godmother again, the child is completely black and has only white paws, otherwise no white hair on the whole body, that happens only every few years: you let me go out, don’t you?’ ‘Hautab! Halbaus!’ replied the mouse, ‘those are such curious names, they make me think.’ ‘You sit there at home in your dark grey cloak and your long hair braid, and start daydreaming: that comes from not going out during the day.’ The mouse tidied up during the cat’s absence and put the house in order, but the gluttonous cat ate the pot of fat completely. ‘When everything is consumed, then one has peace,’ she said to herself, and came home sated and fat only in the night. The mouse asked immediately what the third child had been given as a name. ‘It will probably not please you either,’ said the cat, ‘it is called Ganzaus.’ ‘Ganzaus!’ cried the mouse, ‘that is the most alarming name, I have never seen it printed before. Ganzaus! what does it mean?’ She shook her head, rolled up, and went to sleep. From then on, no one wanted to ask the cat to be godmother anymore. But when winter came and there was nothing to find outside, the mouse thought of their store and said ‘come, cat, let’s go to our pot of fat, we have put aside, it will taste good.’ ‘Yes, well,’ replied the cat, ‘it will taste good to you as if you were sticking your fine tongue out of the window.’ They set off, and when they arrived, the pot of fat was still in its place, but it was empty. ‘Ah,’ said the mouse, ‘now I understand what happened, now it comes to light, you are my true friend! You ate everything up, just as you said you were going to be godmother: first Hautab, then Halbaus, then...’ ‘Be quiet!’ cried the cat, ‘one more word, and I’ll eat you up!’ ‘Ganz aus’ the poor mouse had already said on her tongue, just as it came out, the cat made a leap after her, caught her, and swallowed her whole. See how things go in the world.
