It was long ago a king who had a beautiful pleasure garden behind his castle, where a tree stood that bore golden apples. When the apples ripened, they were counted, but the next morning one was missing. This was reported to the king, and he ordered that a guard should be kept under the tree every night. The king had three sons, of whom he sent the eldest to the garden as the night fell. But as midnight struck, he could not resist sleep, and the next morning another apple was missing. On the following night, the second son had to watch, but he did not fare any better: as the clock struck twelve, he fell asleep, and the next morning another apple was missing. Now it was the turn of the youngest son to keep watch, but the king did not trust him much and thought he would accomplish even less than his brothers. Finally, however, he was allowed to. The young man lay down under the tree, watched, and let sleep not get the better of him. As the clock struck twelve, something rustled through the air, and he saw in the moonlight a bird fly by, whose feathers shone with gold. The bird settled on the tree and had just plucked an apple when the young man shot an arrow at it. The bird took flight, but the arrow struck its feathers, and one of its golden feathers fell to the ground. The young man picked it up, brought it to the king the next morning, and told him what he had seen the night before. The king summoned his council, and everyone declared that a feather like this was worth more than the entire kingdom. 'Is the feather so valuable,' said the king, 'then the one feather will not help me, but I want and must have the whole bird.'

The eldest son set out, relying on his cleverness, and thought he would easily find the golden bird. As he walked a stretch, he saw a fox sitting at the edge of a forest, set up his gun, and aimed at it. The fox cried, 'Don't shoot me, I'll give you good advice. You're on your way to the golden bird, and tonight you'll come to a village where two inns stand facing each other. One is brightly lit, and it's lively inside: don't go in there, but go into the other one, even if it looks poor.' 'How can a foolish animal give me good advice?' thought the king's son, and fired, but missed the fox, which stretched out its tail and quickly ran into the forest. He continued his journey and arrived at the village in the evening, where the two inns stood. In one, there was singing and dancing, while the other looked miserable and neglected. 'I'd be a fool,' thought the king's son, 'if I went into the poor inn and left the nice one.' So he went into the lively one, lived it up, and forgot about the bird, his father, and all good advice.

When some time had passed and the eldest son had not returned home, the second son set out to find the golden bird. As he met the fox, it gave him the same advice, which he did not heed. He came to the two inns, where his brother was standing at the window of the one, from which joyful shouts were coming. He could not resist, went in, and lived only for his pleasures.

Again, some time passed, and the youngest king's son decided to set out and try his luck. His father, however, did not want to let him go. 'It's pointless,' he said, 'he'll find the golden bird even less than his brothers, and if he suffers an accident, he won't know how to help himself; he's not the best.' But finally, when there was no more peace, he let him go. Before the forest, the fox was sitting again, begged for its life, and gave the good advice. The young man was kind and said, 'Don't worry, fox, I won't harm you.' 'It won't be to your regret,' replied the fox, 'and to help you get on faster, get on my back.' And as soon as he had sat down, the fox began to run, and they went over stock and stone, with the hair in the wind whistling. When they came to the village, the young man got off, followed the good advice, and went into the poor inn, where he slept quietly. The next morning, as he came out into the field, the fox was already sitting there and said, 'I'll tell you what to do. Go straight ahead, and you'll come to a castle where a whole group of soldiers is lying, but don't worry about them, for they'll all be asleep and snoring: go straight through and into the castle, and go through all the rooms, until you come to a room where a golden bird is in a wooden cage hanging. Next to it stands an empty gold cage for display, but be careful not to take the bird out of its bad cage and put it into the beautiful one, or it will go badly for you.' After these words, the fox stretched out its tail, and the young man sat on it, and they went on over stock and stone, with the hair in the wind whistling.

When they arrived at the castle, he found everything as the fox had said. The young man came into the room where the golden bird was in a wooden cage, and a golden one stood next to it: the three golden apples, however, lay in the room. Then he thought it was ridiculous to leave the beautiful bird in the common and ugly cage, opened the door, took it out, and put it into the golden one. In that moment, however, the bird let out a piercing shriek. The soldiers awakened, stormed in, and took him to prison. The next morning, he was brought before a court and, since he admitted everything, sentenced to death. But the king promised to spare his life if he brought him the golden horse, which was faster than the wind, and then he would also receive the golden bird as a reward.

The king's son set out, sighed, and was sad, for where would he find the golden horse? As he looked up, he saw his old friend, the fox, sitting by the road. 'You see,' said the fox, 'this is what happened because you didn't listen to me. But be of good cheer, I'll take your part and tell you how to get to the golden horse. You must go straight ahead, and you'll come to a castle where the horse is in the stable. In front of the stable, the stable hands will be lying, but they'll be asleep and snoring, and you can quietly take the golden horse out. But be careful not to put the bad saddle of wood and leather on it, but the golden one that's hanging there, or it will go badly for you.' Then the fox stretched out its tail, the king's son sat on it, and they went on over stock and stone, with the hair in the wind whistling. Everything happened as the fox had said, and he came to the stable, where the golden horse was standing. But as he wanted to put the bad saddle on it, he thought, 'A beautiful animal like this should not be disfigured, I'll put the good saddle on it, which is its due.' As soon as he touched the golden saddle, the horse began to loudly whinny. The stable hands awakened, seized the young man, and threw him into prison. The next morning, he was brought before the court and sentenced to death. But the king promised to spare his life and give him the golden horse if he could bring him the beautiful princess from the golden castle.

With a heavy heart, the young man set out, but to his good fortune, he soon found the faithful fox. 'I should have left you to your misfortune,' said the fox, 'but I have pity on you and will help you out of your trouble. Your way leads you straight to the golden castle: in the evening, you'll arrive, and at night, when everything is quiet, the beautiful princess will go to the bathhouse to bathe. And when she goes in, jump up to her and give her a kiss, then she'll follow you, and you can take her with you: only don't let her say goodbye to her parents first, or it will go badly for you.' Then the fox stretched out its tail, the king's son sat on it, and they went on over stock and stone, with the hair in the wind whistling. When he arrived at the golden castle, everything happened as the fox had said. He waited until midnight, when everything was asleep, and the beautiful princess went to the bathhouse, then he jumped out and gave her a kiss. She said she wanted to go with him, but begged him to let her say goodbye to her parents first. He resisted her requests at first, but when she wept and fell at his feet, he finally gave in. As soon as the princess went to her father's bed, he awakened and all the others in the castle, and the young man was taken prisoner.

The next morning, the king spoke to him, 'Your life is forfeit, and you can only find mercy if you move the mountain that lies in front of my windows, which I cannot see over, and you must do it within eight days. If you succeed, you'll have my daughter as a reward.' The king's son began to dig and shovel without stopping, but when he saw after seven days how little he had accomplished and how all his work was as good as nothing, he fell into great sadness and lost all hope. On the evening of the seventh day, however, the fox appeared and said, 'You don't deserve my help, but go to bed, I'll do the work for you.' The next morning, when he woke up and looked out the window, the mountain had disappeared. The young man rushed to the king and told him that the condition had been fulfilled, and the king had to keep his word and give him his daughter.

Now the two of them set out together, and it didn't take long for the faithful fox to join them. 'You have the best,' said the fox, 'but the beautiful princess also belongs to the golden castle, and that's the golden horse.' 'How can I get it?' asked the king's son. 'I'll tell you,' replied the fox, 'first bring the beautiful princess to the king who sent you to the golden castle. There will be great joy, and they'll give you the golden horse willingly and show it to you. Set off immediately and bid farewell to everyone, last of all the beautiful princess, and when you've got her, take her with a swing and ride away: and no one will be able to catch you, for the horse runs faster than the wind.'

Everything was accomplished successfully, and the king's son led the beautiful princess away on the golden horse. The fox did not stay behind and spoke to the king's son, 'Now I'll also help you get the golden bird. When you're near the castle where the bird is, let the princess get off, and I'll take her in my care. Then ride into the castle courtyard on the golden horse: at the sight, there will be great joy, and they'll bring you the golden bird. When you have the cage in your hand, rush back to us and fetch the princess again.' When the plan was successful, and the king's son wanted to ride back home with his treasures, the fox said, 'Now you must reward me for my help.' 'What do you want?' asked the king's son. 'When we come to the forest, shoot me dead and cut off my head and paws,' said the fox. 'That would be a wonderful thank you,' said the king's son, 'I couldn't possibly do that.' The fox said, 'If you won't do it, I'll leave you, but before I go, I'll give you one more piece of advice. Avoid two things: don't buy gallows meat and don't sit on a well's edge.' With that, the fox ran off into the forest.

The king's son thought, 'This is a strange animal, it has a peculiar fancy. Who would buy gallows meat? And the thought of sitting on a well's edge has never occurred to me.' He rode on with the beautiful princess, and his path led him back to the village where his two brothers had remained. There was a great commotion and noise, and when he asked what was going on, it was said that two people were to be hanged. As he drew closer, he saw that it was his brothers, who had committed all sorts of mischief and had spent all their wealth. He asked if they couldn't be freed. 'If you're willing to pay for them,' replied the people, 'but what would you want to give those bad people your money for and set them free?' He didn't hesitate, paid for them, and when they were released, they continued their journey together.

They came to the forest, where they first met the fox, and as it was cool and pleasant there, and the sun was hot, the two brothers said, 'Let's rest a bit at the well and eat and drink.' He agreed, and while they were talking, he forgot himself and sat down at the well's edge, not noticing anything bad. But the two brothers pushed him backward into the well, took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and rode back home to their father. 'We're not just bringing the golden bird,' they said, 'we've also got the golden horse and the princess from the golden castle.' There was great joy, but the horse did not eat, the bird did not sing, and the princess sat and wept.

The youngest brother, however, was not dead. The well was dry, and he fell onto soft moss without harm. But he couldn't get out. The faithful fox did not leave him either, came down and scolded him for forgetting his advice. 'I can't help it,' said he, 'I'll help you get out of this trouble.' He told him to grab his tail and hold on tight, and then pulled him up. 'You're not out of danger yet,' said the fox, 'your brothers were not sure of your death and have surrounded the forest with guards who will kill you if you show yourself.' As he sat there, a poor man passed by, and the king's son exchanged clothes with him and managed to get to the king's court without being recognized. No one knew him, but the bird began to sing, the horse began to eat, and the beautiful princess stopped weeping. The king asked in wonder, 'What does this mean?' The princess said, 'I don't know, but I was so sad, and now I'm so happy. It's as if my true bridegroom had come.' She told him everything that had happened, although her brothers had threatened her with death if she told anyone. The king ordered all the people in his castle to be brought before him, and the king's son appeared as a poor man in his tattered clothes, but the princess recognized him immediately and flung herself into his arms. The wicked brothers were caught and executed, and the king's son was married to the beautiful princess and designated as the king's heir.

But what happened to the poor fox? Long after, the king's son went back to the forest, and there he met the fox again, who said, 'You've got everything you could wish for, but my misfortune still hasn't ended, and it's in your power to set me free.' And again, the fox begged him to shoot him dead and cut off his head and paws. The king's son did so, and as soon as it was done, the fox transformed into a man and was none other than the brother of the beautiful princess, who was finally freed from the enchantment that had been cast upon him. And now, their happiness was complete, as long as they lived. The king's son and the princess lived happily together, and the fox, who was now a man, stayed with them and became their faithful servant.
