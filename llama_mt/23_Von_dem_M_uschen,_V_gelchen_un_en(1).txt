Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage found themselves in a household, conducted a household, lived a long time in peace and plenty, and prospered in their goods. The bird's work was to fly into the forest every day and bring back wood. The mouse was to carry water, make fire, and lay the table. The sausage was to cook. For those who have it good, always desire new things! So one day, while the bird was on its way, it met another bird, to whom it told and praised its good fortune. But the other bird scolded it, saying it was a poor fool, who did great work for the two at home, but they had good days. For when the mouse had made the fire and carried water, she would go to her little room to rest until she was called to lay the table. The sausage would stay at the stove, watching that the food was cooked well, and when it was almost time to eat, it would slip into the broth or the vegetables, and it would be seasoned, salted, and prepared. Then the bird would come home and lay down its burden, and they would sit down to table, and after eating, they would sleep themselves full until the next morning, and that was a wonderful life.

The bird, on the next day, did not want to go into the woods any more, speaking it had been a long time a servant, and had almost been a fool for them, they should try it once another way, and see how it would be. And though the mouse and the sausage begged hard for it, the bird was master, and it had to be ventured, and so they played, and the lot fell on the sausage, which had to carry wood, the mouse became cook, and the bird had to fetch water.

What happened? The little sausage went off to the woods, the bird made the fire, the mouse set the pot, and they waited alone until the sausage came back and brought wood for the next day. But the sausage stayed out so long that they both thought nothing good would come of it, and the bird flew out into the air to see what was going on. But not far away it found a dog on the way, who had caught the poor sausage as free booty, packed it up, and killed it. The bird complained to the dog of an open robbery, but it did no good, for the dog said he had found false letters on the sausage, and therefore it had forfeited its life.

The bird, sad, took up the wood, flew back home, and told what it had seen and heard. They were very sad, but compared themselves to do the best and to stay together. Therefore, the bird laid the table, and the mouse prepared the food, and wanted to serve it, and to slip into the vegetables, like the sausage had done before, to melt and season it. But before it could get into the middle, it was stopped, and had to give up its skin and hair, and its life as well.

When the bird came and wanted to serve the food, there was no cook to be found. The bird threw the wood around, cried out, and looked for its cook, but could not find it any more. Out of carelessness, the fire got into the wood, and a fire broke out; the bird ran to fetch water, but the bucket fell into the well, and it fell in with it, and could not get out, and had to drown. So the bird and the mouse killed each other.
