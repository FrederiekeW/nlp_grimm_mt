Once upon a time, in a dense forest, lived a poor woodcutter with his wife and two children, a boy named Hänsel and a girl named Grethel. The woodcutter had little to eat and little to break, and when a great famine came to the land, he could no longer provide bread for the family. One evening, as he lay in bed, he thought to himself and worried, "What will become of us? How can we feed our poor children, since we can no longer feed ourselves?" His wife replied, "I know what we can do, my husband. We will take the children into the forest tomorrow morning, where it is thickest. We will make a fire and give each of them a piece of bread, and then we will go to work and leave them there. They will not find their way back home, and we will be rid of them." The woodcutter said, "No, my wife, I will not do that. How can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest, where the wild beasts will soon come and tear them to pieces?" His wife replied, "You are a fool. Then we will all starve to death, and you will have to hew the planks for our coffins." She would not rest until he agreed to do as she said. "But the poor children will haunt me," said the woodcutter.

The two children had not been able to sleep because of hunger and had overheard their stepmother's conversation with their father. Grethel wept bitterly and said to Hänsel, "Now it's all over for us." Hänsel replied, "Don't worry, Grethel, I'll help us." When the old people were asleep, Hänsel got up, put on his little coat, opened the small door, and slipped out. The moon was shining brightly, and the white pebbles in front of the house sparkled like freshly minted coins. Hänsel bent down and put as many of them as he could into his pocket. Then he went back, said to Grethel, "Don't worry, dear sister, and sleep peacefully, God will not abandon us," and got back into bed.

The next morning, before the sun had risen, the stepmother came and woke up the two children, saying, "Get up, you lazybones, we're going to go into the forest and gather firewood." She gave each of them a piece of bread and said, "Here's something for your lunch, but don't eat it until then, you'll get nothing more." Grethel took the bread under her apron, because Hänsel had pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set off together towards the forest. When they had walked for a while, Hänsel stopped and looked back at the house, and did that several times. The father said, "Hänsel, what are you looking at and lagging behind? Be careful and don't forget your legs." "Oh, father," Hänsel replied, "I'm looking at my white kitten, which is sitting on the roof and wants to say goodbye to me." The stepmother said, "Fool, that's not your kitten, it's the morning sun shining on the chimney." Hänsel, however, had not been looking at the kitten, but had been throwing one of the white pebbles from his pocket onto the path.

When they reached the middle of the forest, the father said, "Now, children, gather firewood, I'll make a fire so you don't freeze." Hänsel and Grethel gathered twigs, a small pile high. The twigs were lit, and when the flames were high, the stepmother said, "Now, children, sit by the fire and rest, we'll go into the forest and chop wood. When we're done, we'll come back and pick you up." Hänsel and Grethel sat by the fire, and when it was midday, each of them ate their piece of bread. Because they heard the chopping of the axe, they thought their father was nearby. It was not the axe, but a branch that the father had tied to a thin tree and the wind was making it swing back and forth. And when they had sat there for a long time, their eyes grew heavy with sleep, and they fell fast asleep. When they finally awoke, it was already dark night. Grethel began to weep and said, "How will we ever get out of the forest?" Hänsel comforted her, "Wait a little while, until the moon comes up, then we'll find the way home." And when the full moon rose, Hänsel took his sister by the hand and went along the white pebbles, which shone like freshly minted coins and showed them the way. They walked all night and arrived at their father's house at dawn. They knocked on the door, and when the stepmother opened it and saw that it was Hänsel and Grethel, she said, "You wicked children, what have you been doing sleeping in the forest, we thought you didn't want to come back." The father, however, was overjoyed, for he had been deeply troubled by leaving them alone in the forest.

Not long after, there was again a great need in all corners, and the children heard how their stepmother spoke to their father at night in bed, "Everything is used up, we have only half a loaf of bread left, then the song will be over. The children must go, we'll take them deeper into the forest, so they won't find their way back. Otherwise, there's no salvation for us." The father thought, "It would be better if you shared the last bite with your children." But the stepmother would not listen to anything he said, scolded him, and blamed him. Whoever says A must also say B, and since he had given in the first time, he had to give in the second time as well.

The children, however, had been awake and had overheard the conversation. When the old people were asleep, Hänsel got up, wanted to go out, and gather pebbles, as he had done before, but the stepmother had locked the door, and Hänsel could not get out. But he comforted his sister and said, "Don't cry, Grethel, and sleep peacefully, the dear God will help us."

The next morning, the stepmother came and woke up the children from their bed. They received a piece of bread, but it was smaller than the previous one. On the way to the forest, Hänsel broke the bread in his pocket, stopped often and threw a piece on the ground. "Hänsel, what are you standing and looking around for?" said the father. "I'm looking at my dove, which is sitting on the roof and wants to say goodbye to me," replied Hänsel. "Fool," said the stepmother, "that's not your dove, it's the morning sun shining on the chimney." Hänsel, however, was throwing the pieces of bread onto the path.

The stepmother took the children deeper into the forest, where they had never been before. A large fire was lit again, and the stepmother said, "Stay here, children, and rest if you're tired, we'll go into the forest and chop wood. When we're done, we'll come back and pick you up." When it was midday, Grethel shared her bread with Hänsel, who had thrown his piece of bread onto the path. Then they fell asleep, and the evening passed, but no one came to the poor children. They awoke only in the dark night, and Hänsel comforted his sister, saying, "Wait, Grethel, until the moon comes up, then we'll see the breadcrumbs I threw onto the path, and they will show us the way home." But when the moon came up, they could no longer find the breadcrumbs, because thousands of birds that fly around in the forest and in the fields had eaten them. Hänsel said to Grethel, "We'll find the way home," but they did not find it. They walked all night and another day from morning to evening, but they could not get out of the forest, and they were so hungry, for they had nothing but a few berries that grew on the ground. And because they were so tired that their legs could no longer carry them, they lay down under a tree and fell asleep.

Now it was already the third morning since they had left their father's house. They began to walk again, but they went deeper and deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they would perish. When it was midday, they saw a beautiful white bird sitting on a branch, singing so beautifully that they stopped and listened. And when it finished, it spread its wings and flew ahead of them, and they followed it until they came to a small cottage, where it settled on the roof, and when they came close, they saw that the cottage was made of bread and covered with cake, but the windows were made of white sugar. "We'll have a blessed meal here," said Hänsel, "and I'll take a piece of the roof to eat, Grethel, you can eat from the window, it's sweet." Hänsel reached up and broke off a piece of the roof to taste it, and Grethel stood at the window and licked it. Suddenly, a fine voice called from inside the cottage, "Knup, knup, kneischen, who is licking my cottage?" The children replied, "The wind, the wind, the heavenly child." And they continued eating, not letting themselves be deceived.

Hänsel, who thought the roof was delicious, tore off a large piece of it, and Grethel knocked out a whole round windowpane, sat down, and enjoyed it. Then the door suddenly opened, and an old woman, who leaned on a crutch, came out, Hänsel and Grethel were terrified and dropped what they were holding. The old woman, however, nodded her head and said, "Ah, dear children, who brought you here? Come in and stay with me, nothing bad will happen to you." She took both by the hand and led them into her cottage. There, good food was served, milk, pancakes with sugar, apples, and nuts. Then two beautiful beds were made white, and Hänsel and Grethel lay in them and thought they were in heaven.

The old woman had only pretended to be friendly, she was a wicked witch who was waiting for the children, and had built the bread cottage only to lure them in. If one of them fell into her power, she would kill it, cook it, and eat it, and that was her festival day. Witches have red eyes and cannot see far, but they have a fine sense of smell, like animals, and notice when people are approaching. When Hänsel and Grethel came close, she laughed wickedly and said, "I've got them, they won't escape me again."

Early in the morning, before the children woke up, the witch was already up, and when she saw them lying there so peacefully, with their full rosy cheeks, she muttered to herself, "This will be a good bite." She grabbed Hänsel with her bony hand and carried him to a small stable and locked him in with a grid door; he could scream as much as he wanted, it would do him no good. Then she went to Grethel, woke her up, and said, "Get up, lazybones, go and fetch water and cook something good for your brother, who is sitting outside in the stable and should fatten up. When he's fat, I'll eat him." Grethel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, she had to do what the wicked witch demanded.

The witch cooked the best food for Hänsel, but Grethel got nothing but crab shells. Every morning, the witch would come to the stable and say, "Hänsel, stretch out your fingers, so I can feel if you're getting fat." Hänsel, however, would stretch out a knuckle, and the witch, who had dull eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hänsel's fingers, and wondered why he was not getting fat. After four weeks had passed, and Hänsel remained thin, the witch lost her patience, and she would not wait any longer. "Hey, Grethel," she called out to the girl, "hurry up and fetch water: Hänsel may be fat or thin, tomorrow I'll slaughter and cook him." Ah, how Grethel wept as she had to fetch the water, and how her tears flowed down her cheeks! "Dear God, help us," she cried, "if only the wild beasts in the forest had eaten us, we would have died together." "Spare your shouting," said the witch, "it will do you no good."

The next morning, Grethel had to go out, hang the kettle with water, and light the fire. "First, we'll bake," said the witch, "I've already heated the oven and kneaded the dough." She pushed Grethel out to the oven, from which the flames were already shooting out. "Get in," she said, "and see if it's hot enough, so we can put the bread in." And when Grethel was inside, the witch wanted to shut the oven door, and Grethel was to be roasted, and then she would also be eaten. But Grethel noticed what the witch had in mind and said, "I don't know how to do it; how am I supposed to get in?" "Foolish goose," said the witch, "the opening is large enough, don't you see, I could get in myself." She crept closer and stuck her head into the oven. Then Grethel gave her a push, and she fell far inside, slammed the iron door shut, and pushed the bolt in front of it. Hu! She began to howl, horribly, but Grethel ran away, and the wicked witch had to burn to death.

Grethel ran straight to Hänsel, opened his stable, and said, "Hänsel, we're free, the old witch is dead." Hänsel jumped out, like a bird from a cage when the door is opened. How they rejoiced, hugged each other, ran around, and kissed each other! And because they no longer had to fear anything, they went into the witch's cottage, where there were chests full of pearls and precious stones in every corner. "These are better than pebbles," said Hänsel, and he put as many as he could into his pockets, and Grethel said, "I'll take some too," and filled her apron with them. "But now we'll leave," said Hänsel, "so we can get out of the witch's forest." But when they had walked for a few hours, they came to a large body of water. "We can't cross it," said Hänsel, "I don't see any bridge or stepping stones." "There's no boat either," replied Grethel, "but there's a white duck swimming in the water, if I ask it, it will help us across." Then she called out,

"Entchen, Entchen,
there's Grethel and Hänsel.
No bridge and no stepping stones,
take us on your white back."

The duck swam up, and Hänsel sat on it and asked Grethel to sit beside him. "No," said Grethel, "it will be too heavy for the duck, it should take us across one by one." The good creature did as it was asked, and when they were safely across, they walked on for a while, and the forest became more and more familiar, and finally they saw their father's house from a distance. They began to run, burst into the room, and fell into their father's arms. The man had not had a happy hour since he had left the children in the forest, but the woman was dead. Grethel poured out her apron, and the pearls and precious stones scattered all over the room, and Hänsel threw handful after handful of them out of his pocket. Then all their worries were over, and they lived in joy together. My story is over, and a mouse is running out of the forest, whoever catches it can make a large, large fur cap out of it.
