There was a mother who had a little boy of seven years, who was so beautiful and lovely that no one could look at him without being good to him, and she loved him more than anything in the world. Now it happened that he suddenly fell ill and the dear God took him to himself; the mother could not console herself and wept day and night. Soon afterwards, however, after he had been buried, the child appeared at night in the places where he used to sit and play; the mother wept, and so did the child, and when the morning came, it vanished. But when the mother refused to stop weeping, the child came one night in its white shroud, which it had been laid in the coffin in, and with the wreath on its head, sat down at her feet on the bed and spoke, ‘Oh mother, do stop weeping, otherwise I cannot fall asleep in my coffin, for my shroud will not dry from your tears, which are all falling on it.’ Then the mother was frightened, and stopped weeping. And the next night the child came again, held a little light in its hand, and said, ‘Do you see, now my shroud is almost dry, and I have rest in my grave.’ Then the mother commanded the dear God to take away her sorrow, and bore it patiently, and the child did not come again, but slept in its underground bed.
