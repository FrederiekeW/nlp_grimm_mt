There was once a poor woodcutter who worked from morning till night. When he finally had saved up some money, he spoke to his son, “You are my only child; I want to use the money I earned with bitter sweat to pay for your education. If you learn something virtuous, you can support me in my old age when my limbs are stiff and I sit at home.” The son went to a high school and studied diligently, so that his teachers praised him, and he stayed there for a while. After he had passed through a few schools, but was still not perfect in everything, the poverty that his father had earned had been spent, and he had to return home to him. “Ah,” said the father sorrowfully, “I can give you nothing more and I can earn no more than a daily bread in this dear time.” “Dear father,” replied the son, “do not worry about it. If it is God’s will, it will turn out to your benefit; I will take care of myself.” When the father wanted to go out into the forest to earn some money by cutting down and erecting timber, the son said, “I will go with you and help you.” “Yes, my son,” said the father, “that should be a hardship for you; you are not used to hard work; you won’t be able to endure it; I have only one axe and no money to buy another.” “Go and borrow an axe from the neighbor,” replied the son, “he will lend it to you until I have earned one for myself.”

So the father borrowed an axe from the neighbor, and the next morning, at dawn, they went out together into the forest. The son helped his father and was quite lively and fresh about it. When the sun was overhead, the father said, “We will rest and have lunch; then we will go again.” The son took his bread in his hand and said, “Rest, father, I am not tired; I will go into the forest and look for bird’s nests.” “Oh, you foolish boy,” said the father, “what do you want to run around for? Later you will be tired and won’t be able to lift your arm; stay here and sit down with me.”

The son went into the forest, ate his bread, and was quite cheerful, looking into the green branches to see if he could find a nest. He walked back and forth until he finally came to a large and dangerous oak tree, which was certainly hundreds of years old and could not have been encircled by five people. He stopped and looked at it and thought, “It must be that many birds have built their nests in it.” Then, suddenly, it seemed to him that he heard a voice. He listened and heard it say with a rather dull tone, “Let me out, let me out.” He looked around, but could not see anything, yet it seemed to him as if the voice came from beneath the earth. So he said, “Where are you?” The voice replied, “I am stuck down here among the oak roots. Let me out, let me out.” The student began to clear the area under the tree and search among the roots until he finally found a small hollow in which a glass flask was hidden. He picked it up and held it up to the light, and inside he saw a creature shaped like a frog that was jumping up and down. “Let me out, let me out,” it cried again, and the student, who thought nothing bad of it, removed the stopper from the flask. Immediately a spirit came out and began to grow, and grew so quickly that in a few moments it stood before the student as a terrifying giant, as big as half the tree. “Do you know,” it roared with a terrifying voice, “what your reward will be for letting me out?” “No,” replied the student without fear, “how should I know?” “So I will tell you,” roared the spirit, “my reward will be that I will break your neck.” “You should have told me that earlier,” replied the student, “so I would have left you stuck; but my head will stand firm before you; more people will have to be asked.” “More people, more people,” roared the spirit, “you will have your just reward. Do you think I was locked up out of mercy? No, it was my punishment; I am the mighty Mercury, and whoever sets me free, I will break their neck.” “Be careful,” replied the student, “it won’t go that fast; first, I need to know that you really were in the small flask and that you are the true spirit: can you also go back in? Then I will believe it, and then you can do what you want with me.” The spirit spoke with great pride, “That is a trivial matter,” shrunk itself together and became as thin and small as it was at first, so that it could fit back through the same opening and through the neck of the flask. But as soon as it was inside, the student put the stopper back on and threw the flask back under the oak tree to its old place, and the spirit was deceived.

Now the student wanted to go back to his father, but the spirit cried out in a pitiful voice, “Ah, let me out, let me out.” “No,” replied the student, “not for the second time: whoever has once tried to kill me, I will not let go of when I have caught him again.” “If you set me free,” cried the spirit, “I will give you so much that you will have enough for the rest of your life.” “No,” replied the student, “you would deceive me just like the first time.” “You are ruining your luck,” said the spirit, “I will not harm you, but reward you richly.” The student thought, “I will take a chance; perhaps he will keep his word, and I will not lose anything.” So he removed the stopper, and the spirit came out again, just like the first time, grew and became as big as a giant. “Now you will have your reward,” said the spirit, and handed the student a small cloth, like a plaster, and said, “If you apply one end to a wound, it will heal; and if you apply the other end to steel and iron, it will turn into silver.” “I will have to try it out,” said the student, went to a tree, cut a gash in the bark with his axe, and applied the one end of the cloth to it. Immediately the bark closed up and healed. “Well, it is true,” said the student to the spirit, “now we can part ways.” The spirit thanked him for his release, and the student thanked the spirit for the gift and went back to his father.

“Where have you been wandering?” said the father, “why have you forgotten your work? I told you right away that you wouldn’t be able to accomplish anything.” “Be satisfied, father,” replied the student, “I will make it up to you.” “Yes, make it up to me,” said the father angrily, “that has no sense.” “Be careful, father,” said the student, “I will soon chop down that tree so that it will crash.” The father was angry and said, “You will soon see that you can’t even do that right.” The student took the cloth, applied it to the axe, and gave it a mighty swing. But because the iron had turned into silver, the blade bent. “Oh, father, look at this,” said the student, “what kind of axe did you give me? It is all crooked now.” The father was shocked and said, “Oh, what have you done! Now I have to pay for the axe and I don’t know how.” “Don’t be angry,” replied the student, “I will pay for the axe.”

The father was angry and said, “You fool, how will you pay for the axe? You have nothing but what I give you; those are just student tricks that are stuck in your head, but you don’t understand anything about chopping wood.”

After a while, the student said, “Father, I can’t work anymore; let’s take a break.” “What are you talking about?” replied the father, “Do you think I want to sit around like you? I have to work, but you can go home.” “Father, I am here in the forest for the first time; I don’t know the way home; come with me.” The father was finally persuaded and went with him home. There he said to the student, “Go and sell the damaged axe and see what you can get for it; the rest I will have to earn to pay the neighbor back.” The student took the axe and carried it to the city to a goldsmith, who examined it, weighed it, and said, “It is worth four hundred thalers; I don’t have that much cash.” The student said, “Take what you have, and I will borrow the rest.” The goldsmith gave him three hundred thalers and kept one hundred thalers in debt. Then the student went home and said, “Father, I have money; let’s go and ask the neighbor how much he wants for the axe.” “I know already,” replied the father, “he wants a thaler and six groschen.” “So give him two thalers and twelve groschen, that is double the price, and that is enough; look, I have plenty of money,” and gave the father one hundred thalers and said, “You will never lack anything, live comfortably.” “My God,” said the father, “how did you come to have so much wealth?” Then he told him how everything had happened and how he had trusted in his luck and made such a rich catch. With the remaining money, he went back to the high school and continued his studies. Because he could heal all wounds with his cloth, he became the most famous doctor in the world. And because he could turn iron and steel into silver with the other end of the cloth, he became so rich that he could travel around the world and eventually lived in a large palace, where he was so happy that he wanted to go into the palace to enjoy himself. “Father, Father,” he cried, “look, this is the palace I built for myself; I am so happy that I cannot resist going into it.” “Oh, my son, that is not the palace you built,” said the father, “but another one.” “What other one?” asked the son. “That is the palace you built in your youth, when you were still a student, and in which you were so happy.” “Oh, I don’t remember it anymore,” said the son. “That’s good,” replied the father, “because you were so happy in it that you couldn’t remember it, and now you are so happy that you can see it again, and that is the most beautiful palace you ever built.” “Father, Father,” cried the son, “I am so happy to see it again; I want to enjoy myself in it and be happy in it.” “So will I, my son,” said the father, “and I will enjoy myself in it with you.” “But, Father, Father,” he cried again, “why didn’t you tell me about the palace I built in my youth?” “Because I didn’t care, and because you were so happy in it that you couldn’t remember it, and because you are so happy now that you can see it again, so it’s good that I told you now.” The original text is from the Brothers Grimm’s Kinder- und Hausmärchen (Children’s and Household Tales), published in 1812. I tried to keep the style and tone as close to the original as possible, while still making it understandable for modern English readers. Please note that the translation is not a direct word-for-word translation, but rather a paraphrased version that aims to capture the essence and spirit of the original text. The story is a classic example of a Germanic folktale, and its themes and motifs are still widely recognized and appreciated today. The story is also a great example of the Brothers Grimm’s style of storytelling, which often features clever and resourceful protagonists, as well as a touch of darkness and danger. The story has been translated into many languages and has been adapted into various forms of media, including films, plays, and animated series. It remains a beloved and iconic tale that continues to captivate audiences around the world.
