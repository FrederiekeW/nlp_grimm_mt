Once upon a time, there was a queen who had a little daughter. The child was still small and had to be carried on her arm. One day, the child was naughty, and no matter what the mother said, it wouldn’t calm down. The mother became impatient and, because the ravens were flying around the castle, she opened the window and said, “I wish you were a raven and flew away, so I would have peace.” As soon as she spoke the words, the child was transformed into a raven and flew out of her arm and through the window. The raven flew into a dark forest and stayed there for a long time, and the parents heard nothing from her.

At some point, a man came walking through the forest, heard the raven crying, and followed the sound. As he got closer, the raven spoke to him, “I am a princess by birth, and I have been cursed, you can release me.” “What should I do?” he asked. She said, “Go further into the forest and you will find a house, in which sits an old woman, she will give you food and drink, but you must not take anything, if you eat or drink something, you will fall into a sleep and won’t be able to release me. In the garden behind the house is a large oak tree, you must stand on it and wait for me. For three days, I will come to you every day at two o’clock in a carriage, first with four white horses, then with four red horses, and finally with four black horses, if you are not awake but asleep, I will not be released.”

The man promised to do everything she asked, but the raven said, “Ah, I know it, you will not release me, you will take something from the old woman.” The man promised again that he would not take anything, but when he came to the house, the old woman came to him and said, “Poor man, you look exhausted, come and refresh yourself, eat and drink.” “No,” said the man, “I do not want to eat and drink.” But the old woman would not leave him alone and said, “If you do not want to eat, then take a sip from the glass, it won’t hurt you.” The man let himself be convinced and drank. In the afternoon, around two o’clock, he went out into the garden and wanted to wait on the oak tree for the raven. As he stood there, he suddenly felt very tired and could not overcome it, so he lay down a little. But he did not want to fall asleep. But as soon as he stretched out, his eyes closed on their own, and he fell asleep so deeply that nothing in the world could wake him up.

At two o’clock, the raven came with four white horses, but she was already in deep sorrow and said, “I know he is asleep.” And when she came into the garden, he was lying there on the oak tree and sleeping. She got out of the carriage, went to him, and shook him and called him, but he did not wake up. The next day, at noon, the old woman came again and brought him food and drink, but he did not want to take it. But she would not leave him alone and talked to him until he took another sip from the glass. In the afternoon, around two o’clock, he went out into the garden and wanted to wait on the oak tree for the raven, but he felt an extreme tiredness, so he could not hold himself up, had to lie down, and fell into a deep sleep. When the raven came with four brown horses, she was already in deep sorrow and said, “I know he is asleep.” She went to him, but he was lying there in sleep and could not be woken up. The next day, the old woman asked what would happen, if he ate and drank nothing, would he die? He replied, “I want and must not eat and drink.” But the old woman placed a bowl of food and a glass of wine in front of him, and as the smell rose to him, he could not resist and took a strong drink. When the time came, he went out into the garden and waited on the oak tree for the raven, but he felt even more tired than the previous days, lay down, and fell into a deep sleep. At two o’clock, the raven came with four black horses, and everything was black. She was already in deep sorrow and said, “I know he is asleep and cannot release me.” When she came to him, he was lying there and sleeping deeply. She shook him and called him, but she could not wake him up. Then she laid a loaf of bread next to him, then a piece of meat, and then a flask of wine, and he could take as much as he wanted, but it did not decrease. After that, she took a golden ring from her finger and put it on his finger, and her name was engraved on it. Finally, she laid a letter next to him, in which she wrote what she had given him and that it would never be enough, and it was also written in it, “I see that you will not be able to release me here, but if you still want to release me, come to the golden castle of Stromberg, it is in your power, I am sure of it.” And when she had given him all this, she got into her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.

When the man woke up and saw that he had slept, he was heartbroken from the bottom of his heart and said, “Of course, now she is gone and I have not released her.” Then he saw the things that lay next to him, and he read the letter that was written in it, telling how it had happened. So he set out and went, and wanted to go to the golden castle of Stromberg, but he did not know where it was. Now he had been traveling in the world for a long time, and he came to a dark forest and walked through it for fourteen days, but he could not find his way out. As the evening came, he was so tired that he lay down against a bush and fell asleep. The next day, he went on and in the evening, when he wanted to lie down against a bush again, he heard a howling and crying that he could not fall asleep. And when the time came when people light their lights, he saw one shining, got up, and followed it. Then he came to a house that seemed small, because a large giant stood in front of it. Then he thought to himself, “You go in and the giant sees you, then it’s easy to lose your life.” Finally, he dared and approached. When the giant saw him, he said, “It’s good that you came, I have been hungry for a long time: I want to eat you up as my evening meal.” “Leave that, please,” said the man, “I don’t like to be eaten; if you want to eat, I have enough to satisfy you.” “If that’s true,” said the giant, “then you can stay calm; I wanted to eat you because I had nothing else.” Then they went and sat down at the table, and the man brought bread, wine, and meat, which did not decrease. “This pleases me,” said the giant and ate with great pleasure. After that, the man spoke to him, “Can’t you tell me where the golden castle of Stromberg is?” The giant said, “I will look it up on my map, on which all cities, villages, and houses are marked.” He fetched the map, which he had in the room, and looked for the castle, but it was not there. “It doesn’t matter,” said he, “I have larger maps in the attic; we will look for it there.” But it was also in vain. The man wanted to go on, but the giant asked him to stay a few more days until his brother came home, who had gone to buy food. When the brother came home, they asked him about the golden castle of Stromberg, and he replied, “If I have eaten and am full, then I will look it up on the map.” He climbed up to his room with them and they looked for it on his map, but they could not find it. Then he fetched older maps, and they did not give up until they finally found the golden castle of Stromberg, but it was many thousand miles away. “How will I get there?” asked the man. The giant said, “I have two hours, then I will take you as far as I can, but then I have to go back home and suckle the child we have.” Then the giant took the man as far as about a hundred hours from the castle and said, “The rest of the way you can go alone.” Then he returned, and the man went on, day and night, until he finally came to the golden castle of Stromberg. But it stood on a glass mountain, and the cursed princess was driving her carriage around the castle and then went inside. He was happy when he saw her and wanted to climb up to her, but as he tried, he slipped back down the glass every time. And when he saw that he could not reach her, he became very sad and said to himself, “I will stay down here and wait for her.” So he built a hut and sat in it for a whole year and watched the princess drive by every day, but he could not climb up to her.

One day, he looked out of his hut and saw three robbers fighting, and he called out to them, “God be with you!” They stopped at the call, but when they saw no one, they started fighting again, and this time with great ferocity. Then he called out again, “God be with you!” They stopped again, looked around, but since they saw no one, they started fighting again. Then he called out for the third time, “God be with you!” and thought, “You have to see what these three want to do.” He went out and asked why they were fighting each other. One of them said that he had found a stick, if he hit it against a door, it would open; the other said that he had found a cloak, if he put it on, he would become invisible; the third said that he had caught a horse, with which they could ride anywhere, even up the glass mountain. Now they did not know whether they should keep these things together or whether they should separate. Then the man said, “I will trade you these three things: I have no money, but I have other things that are more valuable. But I must first make a test, so I can see if you are telling the truth.” The robbers let him sit on the horse, put the cloak around him, and gave him the stick in his hand, and when he had all three, they could no longer see him. Then he gave them a good beating and said, “Now, you bearskinners, you have what you deserve: are you satisfied?” Then he rode the horse up the glass mountain and when he came to the castle, it was locked, so he knocked on the door with the stick, and it opened immediately. He entered and went up the stairs until he came to the great hall, where the princess sat with a golden cup of wine in front of her. But she could not see him because he was wearing the cloak. And when he came up to her, he took the ring that she had given him and threw it into the cup, so it rang out. Then she cried, “This is my ring, so the man must be there who will release me.” They searched the whole castle, but he was not there, he had gone out, sat on the horse, and taken off the cloak. When they came to the gate, they saw him and screamed with joy. Then he got off the horse and took the princess in his arms, and she kissed him and said, “Now you have released me, and tomorrow we will celebrate our wedding.” “Yes,” said the man, “that’s good, but I want to ask you something: what is the reason why you were turned into a raven?” She replied, “I was cursed because I did not spare my mother when I was naughty.” “Then,” said the man, “you will not scold me when I am naughty either?” She laughed and said, “No, that doesn’t matter, I will love and protect you, and you will love and protect me, and we will live a happy life.” And when they had spoken like this, the raven was transformed back into the princess, and the two got married the next day.
