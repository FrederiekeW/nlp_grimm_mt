Once upon a time, a king went hunting in a large forest and chased a wild animal with such zeal that none of his people could follow him. As the evening approached, he stopped and looked around, and saw that he had gotten lost. He searched for an exit, but couldn’t find one. Then he saw an old woman with a wobbly head coming towards him; this was a witch. ‘Dear lady,’ he said to her, ‘can you not show me the way through the forest?’ ‘Oh yes, Your Majesty,’ she replied, ‘I can certainly do that, but there is a condition attached to it. If you do not fulfill it, you will never leave the forest and will starve to death there.’ ‘What is this condition?’ asked the king. ‘I have a daughter,’ said the old woman, ‘who is as beautiful as you can find anywhere in the world, and she is well deserving of being your queen. If you want to make her your queen, I will show you the way out of the forest.’ The king, in the anxiety of his heart, agreed, and the old woman led him to her hut, where her daughter was sitting by the fire. She welcomed the king as if she had been expecting him, and he saw that she was very beautiful, but she did not please him, and he could not look at her without secret horror. After he had taken the girl onto his horse, the old woman showed him the way, and the king returned to his royal castle, where the wedding was celebrated.

The king had been married once before and had seven children with his first wife, six boys and one girl, whom he loved more than anything in the world. Because he feared that the stepmother might not treat them well and might even harm them, he sent them to a solitary castle that stood in the middle of a forest. It was so hidden and the path was so difficult to find that he himself would not have found it if a wise woman had not given him a ball of yarn with extraordinary properties; if he threw it in front of him, it would unravel itself and show him the way. The king went out to his beloved children so often that the queen noticed his absence; she became curious and wanted to know what he was doing out in the forest all alone. She gave his servants a lot of money, and they betrayed her the secret and told her about the ball of yarn that could show the way alone. Now she had no peace until she had found out where the king kept the ball of yarn, and then she made small white linen shirts and, since she had learned witchcraft from her mother, she sewed a spell into them. And when the king went on a hunt one day, she took the shirts and went into the forest, and the ball of yarn showed her the way. The children, who saw someone coming from a distance, thought it was their dear father and ran to meet him with joy. Then she threw a shirt over each of them, and as soon as it touched their bodies, they were transformed into swans and flew away over the forest. The queen went back to the castle, happy and thought she had gotten rid of her stepchildren, but the girl was not with the boys, and she didn’t know anything about it. The next day, the king came and wanted to visit his children, but he found no one but the girl. ‘Where are your brothers?’ asked the king. ‘Oh dear father,’ replied the girl, ‘they have left me behind and gone away.’ And she told him that she had seen her brothers flying away as swans from her window and showed him the feathers they had left in the courtyard. The king was sad, but he didn’t think the queen was the one who had done the evil deed, and because he feared that the girl would be taken away too, he wanted to take her with him. But the girl was afraid of the stepmother and begged the king to let her stay in the forest castle for just one more night.

The poor girl thought to herself, ‘I won’t stay here any longer; I’ll go and find my brothers.’ And when night came, she ran away and went straight into the forest. She walked all night and the next day, until she couldn’t go any further due to exhaustion. Then she saw a wild hut and climbed up, and found a room with six small beds, but she was too afraid to get into one of them, so she crawled under one and lay down on the hard floor and wanted to spend the night there. But when the sun began to set, she heard a rustling and saw six swans flying towards the window. They settled on the floor and blew each other and blew their feathers off, and their swan skin slipped off like a shirt. Then she saw the girl and recognized her brothers, and was overjoyed, and crawled out from under the bed. The brothers were just as happy to see their sister as she was to see them, but their joy was short-lived. ‘This is not a place for you to stay,’ they said to her, ‘this is a hideout for robbers, and if they come back and find you, they will kill you.’ ‘Can’t you protect me?’ asked the sister. ‘No,’ they replied, ‘because we can only shed our swan skin for a quarter of an hour every evening, and in that time we have our human form, but then we are transformed back into swans again.’ The sister wept and said, ‘Can’t you be freed from this curse?’ ‘Oh no,’ they replied, ‘the conditions are too hard. You must not speak or laugh for six years, and you must sew six shirts from starflower petals. If a single word comes out of your mouth, all the work will be for nothing.’ And as soon as the brothers had spoken, the quarter of an hour was up, and they flew away as swans again.

The girl made up her mind to free her brothers, even if it cost her life. She left the wild hut and went into the forest, sat down on a tree and spent the night there. The next morning she went out, gathered starflowers, and started sewing. She couldn’t speak to anyone, and she had no desire to laugh; she just sat there and looked at her work. After a long time had passed, it happened that the king of the land was hunting in the forest and his hunters came to the tree where the girl was sitting. They called out to her and asked, ‘Who are you?’ But she gave no answer. ‘Come down to us,’ they said, ‘we won’t harm you.’ She just shook her head. When they continued to question her, she threw down her golden necklace, and thought that would satisfy them. But they wouldn’t give up, and she threw down her belt, and then her garters, and finally everything she had on, except her linen shirt. The hunters still wouldn’t leave her alone, climbed up the tree, took her down, and brought her before the king. The king asked her, ‘Who are you? What are you doing on the tree?’ But she didn’t answer. He asked her in all the languages he knew, but she remained as silent as a fish. But because she was so beautiful, the king’s heart was moved, and he fell deeply in love with her. He put his cloak around her, took her onto his horse, and brought her to his castle. There he had rich clothes made for her, and she shone in her beauty like the bright sun, but she couldn’t speak a word. He put her at his side at table, and her modest demeanor and her good behavior pleased him so much that he said, ‘I want to marry this girl and no other in the world,’ and after a few days, he married her.

But the king had a wicked mother who was unhappy with this marriage and spoke badly of the young queen. ‘Who knows where this girl comes from?’ she said, ‘she can’t speak: she’s not worthy of a king.’ After a year, when the queen gave birth to her first child, the old woman took it away and covered her mouth with blood while she was asleep. Then she went to the king and accused the queen of being a cannibal. The king didn’t believe it and wouldn’t let anyone harm her. But the queen sat quietly and sewed, and paid no attention to anything else. The next time, when she gave birth to a beautiful boy, the old woman did the same thing, but the king couldn’t bring himself to believe her words. He said, ‘She is too devout and good to do such a thing; if she weren’t mute and couldn’t defend herself, her innocence would come to light.’ But when the old woman did the same thing the third time, and the queen was accused of being a cannibal without being able to defend herself, the king was forced to hand her over to the court, and it sentenced her to death by fire.

On the day when the sentence was to be carried out, the old woman was also due to be punished, and the queen had freed her brothers from the curse on the last day of the six years. The six shirts were finished, except for the left sleeve of the last one. When she was led to the stake, she placed the shirts on her arm, and when she stood on top and the fire was about to be lit, she looked around and saw that her rescuers were approaching. The six swans flew towards her, and as they approached, they spread their wings, and she could throw the shirts over them. And when they touched their bodies, the swan skins fell off, and her brothers stood before her in their human form, fresh and beautiful, except for the youngest, who was missing an arm and had a swan’s wing on his back. They hugged and kissed each other, and the queen went to the king, who was shocked, and began to speak and said, ‘My dearest husband, now I can speak and reveal to you that I am innocent and falsely accused.’ And she told him about the old woman’s treachery, who had taken away her three children and hidden them. Then they were brought to the king, and the wicked stepmother was bound to the stake and burned to ashes. The king and the queen, with their six brothers, lived for many years in happiness and peace.
