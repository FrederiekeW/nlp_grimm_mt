It was a queen who had our Lord God close her, so that she bore no children. So she went every morning into the garden and prayed to God in heaven that he might grant her a son or daughter. Then an angel came from heaven and spoke, "Be content, you shall have a son with wondrous thoughts, for whatever he wishes on earth, that he shall receive." She went to the king and told him the joyful news, and when the time came, she bore a son, and the king was in great joy.

Now she went every morning with the child into the menagerie, and washed herself at a clear well. It happened once, when the child was a little older, that it lay on her lap, and she fell asleep. Then the old cook, who knew that the child had wondrous thoughts, came and stole it, took a hen and tore it apart, and poured its blood on her apron and dress. Then he took the child away to a hidden place where it had to be fed by a nurse, and ran to the king and accused the queen of having her child taken away by wild beasts. And when the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed it and became so enraged that he had a deep tower built, in which neither sun nor moon shone, and had his wife locked in and walled up; there she should sit for seven years without food or drink and should perish. But God sent two angels from heaven in the form of white doves, who had to fly to her twice a day and bring her food until the seven years were over.

The cook, however, thought to himself, "The child has wondrous thoughts and I am here, so it could easily bring me into trouble." So he made himself leave the castle and went to the boy, who was already so big that he could speak, and said to him, "Wish for a beautiful castle with a garden and all that belongs to it." And as soon as the words were out of the boy's mouth, everything he had wished for was there. After a time, the cook spoke to him, "It is not good that you are alone, wish for a beautiful maiden as your companion." Then the king's son wished for her, and she stood before him, and she was as beautiful as no painter could paint her. Now the two played together, and had each other dear, and the old cook went hunting like a nobleman. It came to him, however, that the king's son might one day wish to be with his father and thus bring him into great trouble. So he went out, took the girl aside and spoke, "Tonight, when the boy sleeps, go to his bed and stick a knife in his heart and bring me his heart and tongue; and if you don't do it, you'll lose your life." Then he left and when he came back the next day, she had not done it and spoke, "What should I bring about the death of an innocent blood that has not yet harmed anyone?" Said the cook again, "If you don't do it, you'll lose your life yourself." When he was gone, she had a small deer brought, and had it slaughtered, and took the heart and tongue, and put them on a plate, and when she saw the old man come, she said to the boy, "Get into bed and pull the cover over you."

Then the wicked man came in and said, "Where is the heart and tongue of the boy?" The girl handed him the plate, but the king's son threw off the cover and said, "You old sinner, why did you want to kill me? Now I will give you your judgment. You shall be a black poodle dog and have a golden chain around your neck, and you shall eat glowing coals so that the flames shoot out of your throat." And as soon as he had spoken the words, the old man was transformed into a poodle dog and had a golden chain around his neck, and the cooks had to bring him living coals to eat, so that the flames shot out of his throat. Now the king's son stayed there for a little while and thought about his mother and whether she was still alive. Finally, he spoke to the girl, "I want to go back to my fatherland, do you want to come with me, I will take care of you." "Ah," she replied, "the way is so far, and what will I do in a foreign land where I am unknown?" Because it was not her will, and yet they did not want to part from each other, he wished her to be a beautiful poppy and stuck her in his pocket.

Then he left and the poodle dog had to follow him, and he went to his fatherland. Now he went to the tower where his mother was locked in, and because the tower was so high, he wished for a ladder to reach the top. Then he climbed up and looked in and called, "Dearest mother, Queen, are you still alive or dead?" She replied, "I have just eaten and I am still full," and meant that the angels had brought her food. He said, "I am your dear son, whom the wild beasts were supposed to tear from your lap: but I am still alive, and I will soon rescue you."

Now he went down and went to his father, and asked to be received as a foreign hunter, whether he could serve him. The king replied, "Yes, if he had learned and could bring him game, he should come." It had never been the case on the entire border and in the surrounding area that any game had been found. The hunter promised that he would bring him as much game as he needed for the royal table. Then he called the hunting party together, they should all go with him into the forest. They went with him, and outside he ordered them to form a great circle, which was open at one end, and then he got inside and began to wish. Immediately, two hundred and some pieces of game ran into the circle, and the hunters had to shoot them. Then everything was loaded onto sixty farmer's wagons and taken back to the king, so that he could once again decorate his table with game, after he had not had any for many years.

Now the king was overjoyed and ordered that the entire court should dine with him the next day, and he made a great feast. While they were all together, he said to the hunter, "Since you are so skilled, you shall sit next to me." The hunter replied, "Your Majesty, please, I am a poor hunter." The king insisted and said, "You shall sit next to me," until he did. While he sat there, he thought about his beloved mother and wished that one of the king's first servants should go to her in the tower and ask how she was doing, and he asked how the queen was doing in the tower, whether she was still alive or had perished. As soon as he had wished it, the marshal began to speak, and said, "Your Majesty, we live in joy here, how is the queen doing in the tower, whether she is still alive or has perished?" But the king replied, "She had my dear son torn from her lap by the wild beasts, and I don't want to hear about it." Then the hunter stood up and said, "Most gracious father, she is still alive, and I am her son, and it was not the wild beasts who took me, but the wicked cook who took me from her lap when she fell asleep, and stained her apron with the blood of a hen."

Then he took the poodle dog with the golden chain and said, "This is the wicked cook," and had glowing coals brought, which he had to eat in the presence of everyone, so that the flames shot out of his throat. Then he asked the king if he wanted to see him in his true form, and wished him back to the cook, and he stood there immediately with the white apron and the knife by his side. The king, when he saw him, became enraged and ordered that he be thrown into the deepest dungeon. Then the hunter spoke further, "Father, do you also want to see the girl who brought me up so tenderly and then wanted to bring me to my death, although she did not do it, although her own life was at stake?" The king replied, "Yes, I want to see her." The son said, "Most gracious father, I will show you her in the form of a beautiful flower." And he reached into his pocket and pulled out the poppy and put it on the royal table, and it was as beautiful as the king had never seen one before. Then the son said, "Now I will also show you her in her true form," and wished her to be a maiden, and she stood there and was as beautiful as no painter could paint her.

The king sent two chambermaids and two servants down to the tower to bring the queen to the royal table. When she was led there, she ate nothing more and said, "The merciful and gracious God, who has preserved me in the tower, will soon set me free." She lived for three days and then died in peace; and when she was buried, the two white doves followed her, who had brought her food into the tower, and angels from heaven were present, and sat on her grave. The old king had the cook torn into four pieces, but grief ate away at his heart, and he died soon after. The son married the beautiful maiden, whom he had brought with him in the form of a poppy, and whether she is still alive, is known to God.
