Once upon a time, there was a king who had a daughter who was incredibly beautiful, but also very proud and haughty. She rejected one suitor after another, and even mocked them. The king decided to hold a grand feast and invited all the eligible bachelors from far and wide. They were all lined up in order of rank and social standing, with the kings first, followed by the dukes, princes, counts, and barons, and finally the nobles. The king's daughter was then led through the rows, but she found fault with each and every one of them. The first was too fat, "the wine barrel!" she exclaimed. The second was too tall, "tall and swaying has no gait." The third was too short, "short and thick has no skill." The fourth was too pale, "the pale death!" The fifth was too red, "the usurer!" The sixth was not straight enough, "green wood, dried behind the stove!" And so she found fault with each and every one of them, but especially she made fun of a good king who stood at the very top, whose chin was a little crooked. "Oh!" she laughed, "he has a chin like the thrush has a beak!" And from that day on, he was known as Thrush-beard. The old king, seeing that his daughter was only mocking the people and rejecting all the suitors, became angry and swore that she would marry the first beggar who came to his door.

A few days later, a minstrel began to sing under the king's window, in order to earn a small alms. When the king heard it, he said, "Let him come up!" So the minstrel came in, wearing his dirty and tattered clothes, sang in front of the king and his daughter, and then asked for a small gift. The king said, "Your song has pleased me so much that I want to give you my daughter as a wife." The king's daughter was shocked, but the king said, "I have taken an oath to give her to the first beggar who comes to my door, and I will keep it." There was no argument, and the priest was called, and they were married on the spot. When it was all done, the king said, "It doesn't suit you to stay in my castle as a beggar's wife, you can only leave with your husband."

The beggar took her by the hand and led her out of the castle, and she had to walk on foot. As they entered a large forest, she asked, "Whose beautiful forest is this?" "It belongs to King Thrush-beard," replied the beggar. "If you had taken him, it would have been yours." "Oh, poor gentle maiden," she replied, "if only I had taken King Thrush-beard!"

As they walked through a large meadow, she asked again, "Whose beautiful green meadow is this?" "It belongs to King Thrush-beard," replied the beggar. "If you had taken him, it would have been yours." "Oh, poor gentle maiden," she replied, "if only I had taken King Thrush-beard!"

As they walked through a large city, she asked again, "Whose beautiful large city is this?" "It belongs to King Thrush-beard," replied the beggar. "If you had taken him, it would have been yours." "Oh, poor gentle maiden," she replied, "if only I had taken King Thrush-beard!"

"It doesn't please me," said the beggar, "that you always wish for another man as your husband: am I not good enough for you?" Finally, they came to a very small cottage, and she said, "Oh, God, what a small house! Whose wretched little cottage is this?"

The beggar replied, "This is my and your house, where we will live together." She had to bend down to enter the low door. "Where are the servants?" she asked. "What servants?" replied the beggar, "you will have to do everything yourself. Just light the fire and boil some water, so that you can cook my dinner; I am very tired." The king's daughter didn't know how to make a fire or cook, and the beggar had to do it himself, so that it was only just edible. After they had eaten their meager meal, they went to bed. But the next morning, the beggar woke her up early, because she had to take care of the house. For a few days, they lived like this, barely managing to survive.

The beggar said to her, "My dear, this can't go on, we can't just live off our store of food. You have to spin." He went out, cut some willow branches, and brought them back home. She began to spin, but the hard yarn cut into her delicate fingers, making them bleed. "You see," said the beggar, "you're not suited for any work, I'm in a bad situation with you. Now I'll try something else, and start a trade in pots and earthenware. You will have to sell them on the market." "Oh," she thought, "if people from my father's kingdom come to the market and see me sitting there, selling wares, they will surely mock me!" But there was no help for it, she had to agree, or they would starve.

The first time, it went well, because people bought from her because she was beautiful, and paid her what she asked for. Many even gave her the money and left her the pots. They lived off the profits for as long as it lasted, and the beggar then bought a large quantity of new earthenware. She sat with it on a corner of the market, and arranged it around her, and sold it. Suddenly, a drunk Hussar came galloping along, and rode right into the pots, shattering them all into a thousand pieces. She began to cry and didn't know what to do. "Oh, what will happen to me!" she exclaimed, "what will my husband say!" She ran home and told him the bad news. "Who sits on the corner of the market with earthenware?" said the beggar, "just stop crying, I see that you're not suited for any ordinary work. I've been to the king's castle and asked if they need a kitchen maid, and they promised to take you on, in exchange for free food."

The king's daughter became a kitchen maid, had to help the cook, and do the most unpleasant tasks. She made a small pot in each of her aprons, and brought home what was left over from their meals, and they lived off that. It so happened that the eldest son of the king was to be married, and the poor woman went up to the castle, stood in front of the door, and wanted to watch. When the lights were lit, and one after another, the most beautiful people came in, and everything was full of splendor and grandeur, she thought of her fate with a sorrowful heart, and cursed her pride and haughtiness, which had brought her down to such great poverty. The servants sometimes threw her a few scraps of food, which she put in her pot, and wanted to take home. Suddenly, the king's son came in, dressed in silk and velvet, and wearing golden chains around his neck. And when he saw the beautiful woman standing in the doorway, he took her by the hand, and wanted to dance with her, but she refused and was frightened, because she saw that it was King Thrush-beard, whom she had rejected and mocked. Her struggles were useless, he pulled her into the hall: there the belt broke, and the pots fell out, spilling the soup and scattering the scraps. And when the people saw it, a general laughter and mockery broke out, and she was so ashamed that she would have preferred to be buried alive a thousand times. She ran out of the door and wanted to flee, but on the stairs, a man caught up with her, and brought her back: and when she looked at him, it was again King Thrush-beard. He spoke to her kindly, "Don't be afraid, I and the beggar, who lived with you in the wretched little cottage, are one and the same: I disguised myself to win your love, and the Hussar who shattered your pots was also me. All this has happened to bend your proud spirit, and punish you for your haughtiness, with which you mocked me." She wept bitterly, and said, "I have done great wrong, and am not worthy to be your wife." He said, "Comfort yourself, the bad times are over, now we will celebrate our wedding." The ladies-in-waiting came, and put on the most beautiful clothes for her, and her father came, and the whole court, and wished her happiness in her marriage to King Thrush-beard, and the right joy finally began. I wish you and I were there too. I will tell you a farewell message from the queen. "Greet my daughters, greet them God and the king, and tell them, I am not young anymore, but I am still a little proud, because I have such beautiful daughters." I must take my leave now, but I will see you again. We will meet again, and I will tell you more about what has happened in the world. I wish you and your family a good year. "Adieu, my dear, greet God, and wait for me." I am your faithful friend, and will always be true and faithful to you. "Adieu, my faithful friend, greet God, and wait for me."
