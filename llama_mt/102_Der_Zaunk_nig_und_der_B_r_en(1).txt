One summer day, the bear and the wolf were strolling through the forest, when the bear heard the most beautiful singing of a bird and said, “Brother Wolf, what kind of bird is that which sings so beautifully?” “That is the king of birds,” said the wolf, “before whom we must bow down.” But it was the kinglet. “If that is so,” said the bear, “I would also like to see his royal palace, come and show me the way.” “That is not possible as you think,” said the wolf, “you must wait until the queen comes.” Soon after, the queen came, and had food in her beak, and the king also, and wanted to feed their young. The bear would have liked to go straight after them, but the wolf held him back and said, “No, you must wait until the king and queen are gone again.” So they took note of the hole where the nest was, and trotted away again. The bear, however, had no peace, wanted to see the royal palace, and went back after a short while. When the king and queen had properly flown away, he looked in and saw five or six young birds lying inside. “Is that the royal palace?” cried the bear, “that is a wretched palace! you are not children of kings, you are untruthful children.” When the young kinglets heard this, they became extremely angry and cried, “No, we are not that, our parents are honest people; bear, that shall be settled with you.” The bear and the wolf became afraid, they turned back and settled in their dens. The young kinglets, however, cried and made a racket, and when their parents came back with food, they said, “We will not eat a single fly’s leg, and should we starve until you have settled whether we are honest children or not: the bear has been there and scolded us.” Then the old king said, “Be calm, that shall be settled.” He flew with the queen before the bear’s den and called out, “Old bear, why did you scold my children? That shall be your downfall, that we want to settle in a bloody war.” So the bear was threatened with war, and all four-legged beasts were summoned, ox, ass, cow, deer, roe deer, and whatever the earth carries. The kinglet, however, summoned everything that flies in the air; not only the large and small birds, but also the flies, hornets, bees and flies had to come.

When the time came for the war to begin, the kinglet sent scouts out to find out who the commanding general of the enemy was. The fly was the most cunning of all, swarmed in the forest where the enemy was gathered, and finally settled under a leaf on a tree where the password was given. There the bear stood, called the fox in front of him and said, “Fox, you are the slyest of all four-legged beasts, you shall be the general and lead us.” “Good,” said the fox, “but what signs shall we agree on?” No one knew. Then the fox said, “I have a beautiful long bushy tail, which looks almost like a red feather bush; if I hold the tail up, the matter will go well, and you must march forward; if I let it hang down, run as fast as you can.” When the fly had heard this, it flew back home and betrayed the kinglet everything in detail.

When the day broke when the battle was to be fought, the four-legged beasts came rushing with a din that made the earth tremble; the kinglet with his army came also through the air with a rustling, screaming and swarming that made one fear and tremble; and they approached each other from both sides. The kinglet, however, sent the hornets down, they should sit under the fox’s tail and sting with all their might. When the fox got the first sting, he jerked, raised one leg, but endured it and held the tail up; at the second sting he had to let it down for a moment; at the third, however, he could no longer hold it, screamed and took the tail between his legs. When the animals saw this, they thought everything was lost and began to run, each to their den; and the birds had won the battle.

Then the king and queen flew back to their children and called out, “Children, be joyful, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won the war.” The young kinglets, however, said, “We will not eat until the bear comes to the nest and apologizes and says that we are honest children.” Then the kinglet flew before the bear’s den and called out, “Bear, you must go to my children’s nest and apologize and say that they are honest children, otherwise your ribs will be crushed in your chest.” The bear crept out in great fear and apologized. Now the young kinglets were satisfied, sat down together, ate and drank, and made merry until late into the night.
