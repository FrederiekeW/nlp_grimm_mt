A man had seven sons and still no little daughter, as much as he desired; finally, his wife gave him good hope of another child, and when the child was born, it was a girl. The joy was great, but the child was weak and small, and was to have the emergency baptism. The father sent one of the boys quickly to the spring to fetch baptismal water: the other six ran along with him, because each wanted to be the first to scoop up the water. As a result, the jug fell into the well. There they stood and did not know what to do, and none of them dared to go home. When they did not come back, the father grew impatient and said, 'They must have forgotten a game, those godless boys.' He was afraid the girl might die unbaptized and, in anger, he exclaimed, 'I wish the boys all turned into ravens.' Scarcely had the words left his lips when he heard a fluttering above his head in the air, looked up, and saw seven black ravens flying away.

The parents could not take back the curse, and so sorrowful they were over the loss of their seven sons, they were consoled somewhat by their dear little daughter, who soon grew stronger and became more beautiful with each passing day. She did not know for a long time that she had brothers, because the parents avoided mentioning it to her until one day she overheard the people talking about how the girl was well-behaved, but actually responsible for the misfortune of her seven brothers. Then she was deeply troubled, went to her father and mother, and asked if she had brothers and where they had gone. Now the parents could no longer keep the secret, but said it was a divine fate and her birth was only an innocent cause. However, the girl made herself guilty every day and believed she had to redeem her brothers. She had no rest or peace until she secretly set out and went into the wide world to find her brothers somewhere and to set them free, no matter the cost.

She took nothing with her but a ring from her parents as a memento, a loaf of bread for hunger, a jug of water for thirst, and a stool for fatigue. Now she went on and on until she reached the end of the world. There she came to the sun, but it was too hot and terrifying, and devoured the little children. She quickly ran away and went to the moon, but it was too cold and cruel, and when it saw the child, it spoke, 'I smell human flesh.' She quickly moved on and came to the stars, which were friendly and good to her, and each sat on their own stool. The morning star, however, stood up, gave her a little leg, and said, 'If you don't have this leg, you can't open the glass mountain, and in the glass mountain are your brothers.'

The girl took the leg, wrapped it well in a cloth, and went on until she reached the glass mountain. The door was closed, and she wanted to take out the leg, but when she opened the cloth, it was empty, and she had lost the gift of the good stars. What should she do? She wanted to rescue her brothers and had no key to the glass mountain. The good little sister took a knife, cut off a small finger, inserted it into the door, and opened it happily. As she entered, a little dwarf came out to meet her and said, 'My child, what are you looking for?' 'I am looking for my brothers, the seven ravens,' she replied. The dwarf said, 'The lords of the ravens are not at home, but if you want to wait here until they come, you can enter.' On that, the dwarf brought the food of the ravens into the room on seven little plates and in seven little cups, and from each plate she took a small piece of food and from each cup she drank a small sip; into the last cup, however, she dropped the ring she had taken with her.

Suddenly, she heard a fluttering in the air and a loud cry, and the dwarf said, 'Now the lords of the ravens are coming home, flying.' Then they came, wanted to eat and drink, and searched for their plates and cups. One after the other said, 'Who has eaten from my plate? Who has drunk from my cup? It was a human mouth!' And when the seventh reached the bottom of the cup, the ring rolled out to meet him. Then he saw it and recognized it as a ring from father and mother, and said, 'God grant that our sister is here, so we would be redeemed.' As the girl, who was standing behind the door and listening, heard the wish, she stepped forward, and then all the ravens regained their human form. They hugged and kissed each other, and went home in joy. The girl returned to her parents, and the parents kissed and hugged her with double love and gratitude.

The parents were happy and content, the ravens were happy and content, and the girl was happy and content, and the end was good.
