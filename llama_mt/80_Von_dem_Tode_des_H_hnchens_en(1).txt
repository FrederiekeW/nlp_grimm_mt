One day the hen and the rooster went to the nut forest together, and they agreed that whoever found a nut should share it with the other. Now the hen found a large nut, but said nothing and wanted to eat the kernel all by itself. The kernel was so thick, however, that it could not swallow it, and it got stuck in his throat, and he became frightened that he would choke. Then the hen cried, "Rooster, I beg you, run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I will choke." The rooster ran as fast as it could to the well and said, "Well, you must give me water; the hen lies on the nut forest, has swallowed a large nut kernel and is choking." The well replied, "First, go to the bride and ask for red silk." The rooster ran to the bride and said, "Bride, you must give me red silk; I will give the red silk to the well; the well will give me water; I will bring the water to the hen, who lies on the nut forest, has swallowed a large nut kernel and is choking." The bride replied, "First, go and fetch my little wreath that is hanging on a willow tree." The rooster ran to the willow tree, pulled the wreath off the branch, and brought it to the bride, and she gave him red silk for it. He brought the red silk to the well, and the well gave him water for it. Then the rooster brought the water to the hen, but when he came, the hen had already choked to death, and lay there dead and did not stir. Then the rooster was so sad that it cried out loud, and all the animals came and mourned the hen; and six mice built a small cart, to take the hen to the grave. And when the cart was finished, they hitched themselves in front of it, and the rooster drove. On the way, however, the fox came and said, "Where are you going, rooster?" "I'm going to bury my hen." "May I come along?" "Yes, but sit in the back of the cart, for my little horses cannot bear your presence." So the fox sat in the back, then the wolf, the bear, the deer, the lion, and all the animals in the forest. So the journey continued, and they came to a stream. "How shall we now get across?" said the rooster. There lay a straw on the stream, which said, "I will lie across, so you can cross over me." But when the six mice came onto the bridge, the straw slipped and fell into the water, and all six mice fell in and drowned. Then the trouble came again, and a coal came and said, "I am large enough, I will lie across and you can cross over me." The coal lay itself down at the water, but it touched it unfortunately, and it hissed and went out and was dead. When a stone saw this, it pitied the rooster and wanted to help it, and lay itself across the water. Then the rooster pulled the cart itself, but when it had soon pulled it across, and was with the dead hen on the land, it wanted to pull the others who were sitting in the back, but there were too many of them, and the cart fell back, and everything fell into the water and drowned. Then the rooster was alone with the dead hen, and buried it, and placed it in the grave, and made a mound over it, on which it sat and grieved so long that it also died; and then everything was dead.
