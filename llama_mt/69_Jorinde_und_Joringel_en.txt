There was once a great castle in the middle of a large, thick forest, where an old woman lived all alone. She was a sorceress. During the day, she transformed herself into a cat or an owl, but at night, she regained her human form. She could lure wild animals and birds, and then she would slaughter, cook, and roast them. If someone approached the castle within a hundred steps, they had to stand still and could not move until she released them. However, if a chaste maiden entered the forest, she would transform the maiden into a bird, lock her in a cage, and carry the cage into a room in the castle. She had seven thousand such cages with rare birds in the castle.

Once upon a time, there was a maiden named Jorinde, who was more beautiful than all the other girls. She had promised to marry a young man named Joringel, and they were in their wedding preparations, enjoying themselves immensely. To be able to speak with each other in secret, they went for a walk in the forest. ‘Beware,’ said Joringel, ‘do not come too close to the castle.’ It was a beautiful evening, with the sun shining brightly between the tree trunks and the dark green foliage of the forest, and the turtledove sang sorrowfully on the old may trees.

Jorinde would sometimes weep and sit down in the sunlight, lamenting. Joringel also lamented. They were so distressed, as if they were about to die, and they looked around, bewildered, not knowing where to go home. The sun was still half above the mountain and half below. Joringel looked through the underbrush and saw the old castle wall nearby; he was frightened and became deathly pale. Jorinde sang:

‘My little bird with the red ring,
sings sorrow, sorrow, sorrow:
it sings the dove’s death,
sings sorrow, Lei— zucküth, zicküth, zicküth.’

Joringel looked at Jorinde. Jorinde had transformed into a nightingale, singing ‘zicküth, zicküth.’ An owl with glowing eyes flew three times around her and shouted three times ‘schu, hu, hu, hu.’ Joringel could not move: he stood there like a stone, unable to weep, speak, or move his hands or feet. When the sun had set, the owl flew into a bush, and soon an old, crooked woman emerged from it, yellow and thin: large red eyes, a crooked nose that reached to the chin. She muttered, picked up the nightingale, and carried it away on her hand. Joringel could not speak, could not move from the spot; the nightingale was gone. Finally, the woman returned and said in a dull voice, ‘Greetings, Zachiel, when the moon shines in the cauldron, loosen the rope, Zachiel, at the right moment.’ Joringel was freed. He fell to his knees before the woman and begged her to give him back his Jorinde, but she said he would never have her again and left. He called out, wept, and lamented, but it was all in vain. ‘Oh, what shall become of me?’ Joringel went away and eventually came to a foreign village, where he took care of the sheep for a long time. Often he would walk around the castle, but not too close. One night, he had a dream that he would find a red flower with a large, beautiful pearl in the middle. The flower broke off, and he went to the castle with it. Everything he touched with the flower was freed from the sorcery. He also dreamed that he would get his Jorinde back through the flower. In the morning, he began to search for such a flower, and he searched until the ninth day, when he found the red flower early in the morning. In the middle of the flower was a large droplet, as big as the most beautiful pearl. He carried the flower day and night to the castle. When he approached the castle within a hundred steps, he was not held back, but walked on until he reached the gate. Joringel was overjoyed and touched the gate with the flower, and it swung open. He entered the castle, walked through the courtyard, and listened for the sound of the many birds. Finally, he heard them. He went and found the hall, where the sorceress was feeding the birds in the seven thousand cages. When she saw Joringel, she became angry, very angry, scolded, and spat venom and gall at him, but she could not move two steps closer to him. He did not turn to her and went to look at the cages with the birds; there were many hundred nightingales, and how was he to find his Jorinde among them? As he looked on, the old woman secretly took a cage with a bird and carried it to the door. Quickly, Joringel sprang after her, touched the cage with the flower and the old woman, and now she could do no more magic. Jorinde stood there, had him around her neck, and was as beautiful as she had been before. Then he also turned all the other birds back into maidens, and they went home together, living happily ever after. And the old sorceress was locked in the castle, and no one could free her.
