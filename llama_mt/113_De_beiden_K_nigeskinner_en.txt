And what the king had once been, he had a little boy who had a mark on him, that he should be killed by a stag when he was seven years old. As he now was so aware of this, the hunters went out one day to hunt. In the woods, where the king's son came to the others from another way, he saw a great stag, which he wanted to shoot, he could not hit it with three shots; at last the stag ran so long out of the woods, until he stood at last so a great long man in front of the stag, who said 'now it's good, that I have it, I have already chased six or seven grey squirrels through the caput and have not been able to catch them.' Then he took me with him and slipped me through a great water until to a great king's castle, where he sat down and ate something. As they had eaten something together, the king said 'I have three daughters, you must stay with the eldest, from this evening at nine o'clock until morning six, and I will come every time the clock strikes, myself and call, and if you then do not give me an answer, so you will be killed in the morning, but if you always give me an answer, so you will have to stay with me for a long time.' As the young men came to the castle chamber, there stood a stone Christopher, to whom the king's daughter said to him 'at nine o'clock come to me, every hour until it strikes three, when he asks, so give him an answer instead of the king's son.' Then the stone Christopher nodded with his head completely and then gradually slower, until he finally stood still. The next morning, the king said to him 'you have done well, but my daughters I cannot give you, you must stay with the second daughter tonight, then I will think whether you can have my eldest daughter for a wife; but I will come every hour myself, and when I call, so answer me, and if I call and you do not answer, so your blood will flow for me.' And then the two went to the castle chamber, where there stood a larger stone Christopher, to whom the king's daughter said 'when my father calls, so answer you.' Then the large stone Christopher nodded again with his head completely and then gradually slower, until he finally stood still. And the king's son lay down on the threshold, laid his hand under his head and fell asleep. The next morning, the king saw him 'you have done well, but my daughters I cannot give you, you must stay with the youngest king's daughter tonight, then I will think whether you can have my second daughter for a wife; but I will come every hour myself, and when I call, so answer me, and if I call and you do not answer, so your blood will flow for me.' Then they went together to the castle chamber, where there was a much larger and longer Christopher, as with the two first. Then the king's daughter said to him 'when my father calls, so answer you,' then the large long stone Christopher nodded well for half an hour with his head, until his head finally stood still. And the king's son lay down on the threshold and fell asleep. The next morning, the king said 'you have done well, but I can never give you my daughters, I have a great wall, if you do not remove it from this morning until evening, so I will think whether you can have my eldest daughter for a wife; but I will come every hour myself, and when I call, so answer me, and if I call and you do not answer, so your blood will flow for me.' Then he gave him a grey axe, a grey spade and a grey hatchet with him. When he came into the woods, he chopped once, the axe flew out; then he took the spade and chopped once with the hatchet on it, and it was so short and small as a grain of sand. Then he was so sad and believed that he must die, and he sat down and wept. As it was now midday, the king said 'one of my daughters must bring you something to eat.' 'No,' said the two eldest, 'how will you bring something, where he has just been sleeping?' Then the youngest had to go and bring something to eat. When he came to the wall, he asked them how he would go. 'Oh,' said they, 'it will go badly for you.' Then he said he could not come, he must die, he would not eat any more. Then they gave him so many good words, he wanted to try it: then he came and ate something. As he had eaten something, they said 'I will first give you a bit to drink, then you will be sensible again.' Then they gave him to drink, then he became so weak and slipped in, and then they took his dock and bound a knot in it, and struck him three times on the ear and said 'Aweggers, come out!' Then just as many earthmen came out and asked what the king's daughter had ordered. Then they said 'in the time of three hours, you must remove the great wall and set the whole woods in order.' Then the earthmen went around and called their whole kinship to help them. Then they started at once, and as the three hours were up, everything was done: and then they came back to the king's daughter and saw her. Then they took their white dock and said 'Aweggers, to the house!' Then they all went their way. When the king's son woke up, he became so weak that he said 'if it is now six o'clock, then come to the house.' He had done so, and when the king asked him 'have you removed the wall?' 'Yes,' said the king's son. As they sat at a table, the king said 'I can never give you my daughters, before the two eldest have asked him.' Then the king's son and the king's daughter were both very sad, and the king's son did not know how to help himself. Then he went one night to the king's daughter and ran away with her. As he had gone a bit, he heard the daughter cry out and said 'oh, where shall we do now? I will go to the church and to the pastor.' As the king came to the place, there stood a church, and on the pulpit was a pastor preaching: then he heard the sermon and went back home. Then the queen asked him why he had not brought her, and he said 'no, I have been chasing them for so long, and as I thought I was ahead, there stood a church and on the pulpit a pastor preaching.' 'You should have brought the pastor,' said the queen, 'the church would have come: that I would send you, that would not help anything, I must go myself.' As they had gone a bit further, the king's daughter turned around and saw her mother coming and said 'now we are unlucky, now my mother is coming herself: I will go to the dike and to the fish.' As the mother came to the place, there was a great dike, and in the middle a fish was jumping around and kicking with its head out of the water and was very funny. Then she wanted to catch the fish at once, but she could not catch it at all. Then she became very angry and drank the whole dike dry, that she would catch the fish, but then she became so ill that she had to spit out the dike again. Then she said 'I see now that nothing can help us.' Then she went back home, and the queen gave the daughter three hazelnuts and said 'you can use these when you are in your greatest need.' And then the young people went their way again. As they had gone for a long time, they came to the castle, where the king's son was, and there was a village. As they came closer, the king's son said'stay here, my dear, I will first go to the castle, and then I will come with the wagon and the bedridden and fetch you.' As he came to the castle, he became so weak that the king's son was now again, and he told him that he had a bride, and she was now in the village, and they would follow with the wagon and fetch her. Then they were all excited, and many bedridden people got on the wagon. As the king's son wanted to get on the wagon, his mother gave him a kiss, and he had forgotten everything that had happened and what he wanted to do. Then the mother told them to get off the wagon, and they all went back home. The bride, however, sat in the village and waited and waited and thought that he would come and fetch her, but no one came. Then she went to the mill, which was near the castle, where she had to sit all day by the water and clean the vessels. The queen went one day to the castle and walked by the water and saw the brave girl sitting there, and said 'what a brave girl! What pleased me so much!' Then she looked at her for a long time, but no one could recognize her. A long time passed, and the queen had been searching for her son for a long time, and he had long since left the world. As the bride arrived, they were supposed to get married together. There were so many people who wanted to see it, that the bride said to the miller 'I think I could give you a dowry.' The miller said 'go ahead.' As she was about to leave, she put one of the three hazelnuts on the miller's head, and he was so enchanted that he put a beautiful dress in it, and it grew and grew, and she put it on and went to the church and stood on the altar. Then the bridegroom and the bride came and sat down on the altar, and as the pastor wanted to marry them, the bride looked to the side and saw the beautiful dress standing there, and she stood up and said 'I will not marry you until I have a dress as beautiful as the queen's.' Then they went back home and asked the queen if she would sell the dress, but she said 'no, I will not sell it, but I will give it away.' Then they asked her what she would do, and she said 'if you want to sleep in the daughter's bed tonight, then I will give you the dress.' Then the bedridden people gave the king's son a sleeping draught, and he lay down in the bed and slept all night, and the bedridden people told him all the things they had done, how they had removed the wall, how they had cleaned the dike, how they had built the castle, how they had made him go to the church and to the dike, and he had forgotten everything. The next morning, the king's son got up, and the bedridden people gave him another sleeping draught, and he lay down in the bed again and slept all night. The next morning, the bedridden people gave him a third sleeping draught, and he lay down in the bed again and slept all night. The next morning, the king's son got up, and the bedridden people told him all the things they had done, and he became so weak that he said 'if it is now six o'clock, then come to the house.' He had done so, and when the king asked him 'have you removed the wall?' 'Yes,' said the king's son. As they sat at a table, the king said'my youngest daughter I can never give you, before the two eldest have asked him.' Then the king's son and the king's daughter were both very sad, and the king's son did not know how to help himself. Then he went one night to the king's daughter and ran away with her.

Then they were all excited, and many bedridden people got on the wagon. As the king's son wanted to get on the wagon, his mother gave him a kiss, and he had forgotten everything that had happened and what he wanted to do. Then the mother told them to get off the wagon, and they all went back home. The bride, however, sat in the village and waited and waited and thought that he would come and fetch her, but no one came. Then she went to the mill, which was near the castle, where she had to sit all day by the water and clean the vessels. The queen went one day to the castle and walked by the water and saw the brave girl sitting there, and said 'what a brave girl! What pleased me so much!' Then she looked at her for a long time, but no one could recognize her. A long time passed, and the queen had been searching for her son for a long time, and he had long since left the world. As the bride arrived, they were supposed to get married together. There were so many people who wanted to see it, that the bride said to the miller 'I think I could give you a dowry.' The miller said 'go ahead.' As she was about to leave, she put one of the three hazelnuts on the miller's head, and he was so enchanted that he put a beautiful dress in it, and it grew and grew, and she put it on and went to the church and stood on the altar. Then the bridegroom and the bride came and sat down on the altar, and as the pastor wanted to marry them, the bride looked to the side and saw the beautiful dress standing there, and she stood up and said 'I will not marry you until I have a dress as beautiful as the queen's.' Then they went back home and asked the queen if she would sell the dress, but she said 'no, I will not sell it, but I will give it away.' Then they asked her what she would do, and she said 'if you want to sleep in the daughter's bed tonight, then I will give you the dress.' Then the bedridden people gave the king's son a sleeping draught, and he lay down in the bed and slept all night, and the bedridden people told him all the things they had done, how they had removed the wall, how they had cleaned the dike, how they had built the castle, how they had made him go to the church and to the dike, and he had forgotten everything. The next morning, the king's son got up, and the bedridden people gave him another sleeping draught, and he lay down in the bed again and slept all night. The next morning, the bedridden people gave him a third sleeping draught, and he lay down in the bed again and slept all night. The next morning, the king's son got up, and the bedridden people told him all the things they had done, and he became so weak that he said 'if it is now six o'clock, then come to the house.' He had done so, and when the king asked him 'have you removed the wall?' 'Yes,' said the king's son. As they sat at a table, the king said'my youngest daughter I can never give you, before the two eldest have asked him.' Then the king's son and the king's daughter were both very sad, and the king's son did not know how to help himself. Then he went one night to the king's daughter and ran away with her. As he had gone a bit, he heard the daughter cry out and said 'oh, where shall we do now? I will go to the church and to the pastor.' As the king came to the place, there stood a church, and on the pulpit was a pastor preaching: then he heard the sermon and went back home. Then the queen asked him why he had not brought her, and he said 'no, I have been chasing them for so long, and as I thought I was ahead, there stood a church and on the pulpit a pastor preaching.' 'You should have brought the pastor,' said the queen, 'the church would have come: that I would send you, that would not help anything, I must go myself.' As they had gone a bit further, the king's daughter turned around and saw her mother coming and said 'now we are unlucky, now my mother is coming herself: I will go to the dike and to the fish.' As the mother came to the place, there was a great dike, and in the middle a fish was jumping around and kicking with its head out of the water and was very funny. Then she wanted to catch the fish at once, but she could not catch it at all. Then she became very angry and drank the whole dike dry, that she would catch the fish, but then she became so ill that she had to spit out the dike again. Then she said 'I see now that nothing can help us.' Then she went back home, and the queen gave the daughter three hazelnuts and said 'you can use these when you are in your greatest need.' And then the young people went their way again. As they had gone for a long time, they came to the castle, where the king's son was, and there was a village. As they came closer, the king's son said'stay here, my dear, I will first go to the castle, and then I will come with the wagon and the bedridden and fetch you.' As he came to the castle, he became so weak that the king's son was now again, and he told him that he had a bride, and she was now in the village, and they would follow with the wagon and fetch her.
