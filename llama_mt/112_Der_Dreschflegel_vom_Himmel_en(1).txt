Once upon a time a farmer was driving his oxen to the field to plow. When he arrived at the field, the two animals' horns began to grow and grow, and when he wanted to go home, they were so large that he couldn't get through the gate. Fortunately, a butcher was passing by and he handed them over to him. They made a deal that the farmer would bring the butcher a measure of rapeseed, and the butcher would then reckon out a Brabant thaler for each grain. That's a good sale! The farmer went home and carried the measure of rapeseed on his back; on the way, however, he lost a grain from the sack. The butcher paid him as agreed, but if the farmer hadn't lost the grain, he would have had one more Brabant thaler. Meanwhile, as he was returning home, a tree had grown from the grain, reaching all the way to the sky. The farmer thought, 'Since the opportunity is there, you must see what the angels are doing up there and take a look at them.' So he climbed up and saw that the angels were threshing oats and watched them do it; as he was watching, he noticed that the tree on which he stood began to sway, and he looked down and saw that someone was about to knock him off. 'If you fell down, that would be a bad thing,' he thought, and in his distress he didn't know what else to do than to take some chaff from the oats that lay heaped up there and spin it into a rope. He also grabbed a pitchfork and a flail that lay around in the sky and let himself down on the rope. But he landed on the earth right into a deep, deep hole, and it was a lucky thing that he had the pitchfork, because he used it to hack out a staircase, climbed up, and brought the flail to the landmark as a proof of his story, so that no one could doubt it any longer.
