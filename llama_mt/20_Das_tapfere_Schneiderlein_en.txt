On a summer morning, a little tailor sat at his table by the window, in good spirits, and sewing with all his might. Then a peasant woman came down the street and called out, "Good meat for sale! Good meat for sale!" The sound of this was pleasant to the little tailor's ears, and he poked his delicate head out the window and called out, "Here, dear woman, here you can sell your goods." The woman climbed the three stairs with her heavy basket to the tailor's and had to unpack all the pots in front of him. He looked at them all, lifted them up, sniffed at them, and finally said, "The meat seems good to me; weigh it out for me, dear woman, even if it's only a quarter pound, I don't care." The woman, who had hoped to make a good sale, gave him what he wanted, but went away grumbling and annoyed. "Now, may God bless the meat and give me strength and courage," the little tailor said, and pulled out the bread from the cupboard, cut a piece off the whole loaf, and spread the meat on top. "It won't taste bitter," he said, "but first I'll finish sewing this coat, before I take a bite." He put the bread down beside him, continued sewing, and made larger stitches with joy. Meanwhile, the smell of the sweet meat wafted up to the wall, where the flies were sitting in large numbers, and they were attracted to it and settled on it in a swarm. "Who invited you?" the little tailor said, and chased the unwanted guests away. The flies, who didn't understand German, wouldn't be chased away, but came back in increasing numbers. Finally, the little tailor got angry, like they say, and grabbed a cloth rag from his cupboard, and said, "Wait, I'll give you something!" and slapped it on them. When it was over and he counted, there were no fewer than seven dead flies lying in front of him, stretching their legs. "You're a real man, aren't you?" he said, and had to admire his own bravery, "This will be known throughout the city." And in his haste, the little tailor cut himself a belt, sewed it, and embroidered on it with large letters: "Seven with one blow!" "Oh, what a city!" he said, "The whole world will hear about it!" and his heart was trembling with joy like a lamb's tail.

The little tailor put on the belt and wanted to go out into the world, because he thought his workshop was too small for his bravery. Before he left, he searched the house to see if there was anything he could take with him, but he only found an old cheese, which he stuffed into his pocket. Outside the door, he noticed a bird that had caught itself in the bushes, and it had to go into the cheese in his pocket. Now he took the path bravely between the legs, and because he was light and agile, he felt no fatigue. The path led him up a mountain, and when he reached the highest peak, there sat a giant, looking around leisurely. The little tailor went up to him boldly, spoke to him, and said, "Good day, comrade, don't you sit there and look out over the wide world? I'm on my way there too, and I want to try my luck. Do you want to come with me?" The giant looked at the little tailor with contempt and said, "You rascal! You miserable wretch!" "That's right," the little tailor replied, unbuttoning his coat and showing the giant the belt, "there you can read what kind of man I am." The giant read "Seven with one blow," thought it were people that the little tailor had killed, and had a bit of respect for the little man. But he wanted to test him, took a stone in his hand, and pressed it together so that the water came out. "Do that for me," he said, "if you're strong." "Is that all?" said the little tailor, "that's child's play," he reached into his pocket, pulled out the soft cheese, and pressed it so that the juice came out. "How's that?" he said, "was that better?" The giant didn't know what to say, and couldn't believe the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high that it was barely visible to the eye: "Now, you little man, do that for me." "Well thrown," said the little tailor, "but the stone fell back down to the ground, I'll throw one that won't come back; I'll throw this bird," he reached into his pocket, pulled out the bird, and threw it into the air. The bird, happy to be free, flew away and didn't come back. "How do you like that?" the little tailor asked. "You can throw, I'll give you that," said the giant, "but now let's see if you can carry something substantial." He led the little tailor to a large oak tree that had fallen on the ground, and said, "If you're strong enough, help me carry the tree out of the forest." "Of course," the little tailor replied, "you take the trunk on your shoulder, I'll take the branches and leaves, that's the heavy part." The giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the little tailor sat on a branch, and the giant, who couldn't look around, had to carry the whole tree and the little tailor on top of it. It was fun and games behind them, and they sang the song "Three tailors rode out to the gate" as if carrying a tree was child's play. The giant, after carrying the heavy load for a while, couldn't go any further and said, "Wait, I have to drop the tree." The little tailor jumped down quickly, grabbed the tree with both arms, and said to the giant, "You're such a big man, and you can't even carry a tree!"

They continued on their way together, and when they passed by an apple tree, the giant took the branches with the ripest apples and bent them down, handing them to the little tailor to eat. But the little tailor was too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let go, the tree sprang back up, and the little tailor was lifted into the air with it. When he fell back down without harm, the giant said, "What is this? You can't even hold onto a weak branch?" "It's not a lack of strength," the little tailor replied, "do you think that's something for someone who has killed seven with one blow? I jumped over the tree because the hunters were shooting down in the bushes. Try it yourself if you can." The giant tried, but couldn't jump over the tree, and got stuck in the branches, so the little tailor was still in the lead.

The giant said, "If you're such a brave man, come with me to our cave and spend the night with us." The little tailor agreed and followed him. When they arrived at the cave, there were other giants sitting by the fire, each with a roasted sheep in their hands and eating it. The little tailor looked around and thought, "It's much wider here than in my workshop." The giant showed him a bed and said he should lie down and take a nap. But the little tailor thought the bed was too big, so he crawled into a corner.

At midnight, the giant thought the little tailor was fast asleep, so he stood up, took a large iron bar, and smashed the bed with one blow, thinking he had killed a grasshopper. In the morning, the giants went into the forest and had completely forgotten about the little tailor, but it came out of the cave, looking happy and adventurous, and the giants were frightened, thinking it might attack them and kill them all, and they ran away in a hurry.

The little tailor continued on his way, always following his sharp nose. After a long time, it came to the courtyard of a royal palace, and since it felt tired, it lay down in the grass and fell asleep. While it was sleeping, people came and looked at it from all sides, and read the belt: "Seven with one blow." "Oh," they said, "what a great warrior is this, right in the middle of peace? This must be a mighty lord." They went and reported it to the king, and said that if war broke out, this would be a valuable and useful man, whom they could not afford to lose. The king liked the advice and sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor, who should offer him military service when he woke up. The courtier stayed by the sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes, and then presented his request. "That's exactly why I'm here," the little tailor replied, "I'm ready to serve the king." So he was received with honor and a special room was assigned to him.

But the soldiers were dissatisfied with the little tailor and wished he was a thousand miles away. "What will become of us?" they said among themselves, "if we quarrel with him and he kills seven with one blow, we can't hold our own." So they made up their minds, went to the king, and begged for their discharge. "We're not suited," they said, "to serve alongside a man who kills seven with one blow." The king was sad that he had to lose all his loyal soldiers because of one man, and wished he had never seen him, and would have been happy to get rid of him. But he was afraid to dismiss him, because he feared that he might kill him and his people and take the throne for himself. He thought for a long time, and finally found a plan. He sent to the little tailor and told him that since he was such a great warrior, he wanted to offer him a proposal. In a forest in his kingdom, there lived two giants who were causing great damage by robbing, murdering, burning, and setting fire to great destruction. No one could approach them without putting themselves in danger. If he could overcome and kill these two giants, he would give him his only daughter in marriage and half the kingdom as dowry, and also send a hundred horsemen to support him. "That would be something for a man like you," the little tailor thought, "a beautiful princess and half a kingdom would not be offered to him every day." "Yes," he replied, "I'll catch the giants, and I don't need the hundred horsemen: whoever kills seven with one blow doesn't need to be afraid of two."

The little tailor set out, and the hundred horsemen followed him. When he came to the edge of the forest, he said to his companions, "Stay here, I'll deal with the giants on my own." Then he jumped into the forest and looked around. After a while, he spotted the two giants, who were lying under a tree and snoring so loudly that the branches were bending up and down. The little tailor, not lazy, filled his pockets with stones and climbed up the tree. When he was in the middle, he sat down over the sleeping giants and let one stone after another fall on their chests. The first giant didn't notice anything for a long time, but finally woke up, shook his companion, and said, "What are you hitting me?" "You're dreaming," the other replied, "I'm not hitting you." They lay down again, and the little tailor threw another stone at the second giant. "What's going on?" the first giant shouted, "Why are you throwing me?" "I'm not throwing you," the second replied, and grumbled. They argued back and forth for a while, but eventually gave up and fell asleep again. The little tailor started his game again, searched for the biggest stone, and threw it with all his might at the first giant. "That's too much!" the giant shouted, jumped up like a madman, and pushed his companion against the tree so hard that it shook. The second giant paid him back in kind, and they got into such a rage that they tore trees out of the ground, attacked each other, and didn't stop until they both fell dead on the ground. The little tailor jumped down and said, "What luck! If they had torn out the tree I was sitting on, I would have had to jump to another one like a squirrel: but one of them is flighty!"

He drew his sword and gave each of them a few good blows in the chest, then went out to the horsemen and said, "The job is done, I've killed both giants: but it was a hard fight, they tore trees out of the ground and defended themselves, but that doesn't help if someone comes who kills seven with one blow." "Aren't you hurt?" the horsemen asked. "Not a hair was harmed," the little tailor replied. The horsemen didn't believe him and rode into the forest to see for themselves, where they found the giants dead in their blood, and the torn-out trees around them.

The little tailor demanded the promised reward from the king, but the king was sorry he had made the promise and thought of a new plan to get rid of the little tailor. "Before you marry my daughter and get half the kingdom," he said, "you must first catch a wild boar that is causing great damage in the forest. The hunters will give you their support." "That's child's play," the little tailor said, "I'll do it without the hunters." He took a rope and an axe with him, and went into the forest, leaving the horsemen behind. When the wild boar saw him, it ran towards him with foaming mouth and sharp teeth, and wanted to throw him to the ground, but the little tailor jumped into a nearby chapel, climbed up to the window, and jumped out again. The boar followed him, but he jumped around the chapel and slammed the door shut behind him, trapping the boar inside. The little tailor went to the king, who was now forced to keep his promise and give him his daughter and half the kingdom.

But the king's daughter soon realized that her husband was not a great warrior, but a little tailor, and she complained to her father, who advised her to have the little tailor taken away from her at night, bound and carried away on a ship to a distant land. But the king's valet, who had heard everything, was fond of the little tailor and warned him of the plan. "I'll put a stop to that," said the little tailor. In the evening, the little tailor pretended to go to sleep, but when his wife thought he was asleep, she got up, opened the door, and lay back down. The little tailor, who was only pretending to sleep, started shouting at the top of his lungs, "Young man, make me a coat and mend my pants, or I'll give you a good beating! I've killed seven with one blow, two giants, an aurochs, and a wild boar, and I shouldn't be afraid of you and your men outside the door!" When the men heard the little tailor shouting, they were terrified and ran away as if the devil himself was after them. And so the little tailor remained a king for the rest of his life.
