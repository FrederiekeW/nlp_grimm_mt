A former soldier had nothing to live on and did not know how to help himself. So he went out into the woods and after a while he met a small man, who was the devil. The little man said to him, “What’s wrong with you? You look so gloomy.” The soldier said, “I have hunger but no money.” The devil said, “Do you want to rent yourself out to me and be my servant? Then you will have enough for your life. You will serve me for seven years, and then you will be free again. But I tell you, you must not wash yourself, not comb yourself, not snip, not cut your nails or hair, and not wipe your eyes with water.” The soldier said, “Alright, I’ll take care of it if it can’t be otherwise,” and went with the little man, who led him straight into hell. Then he told him what he had to do: he had to stir the fire under the cauldrons where the hellish meat was cooking, keep the house clean, sweep the dung behind the door, and see to everything being in order. But if he looked into the cauldrons even once, it would be bad for him. The soldier said, “Alright, I’ll take care of it.” Then the old devil went out again on his walk, and the soldier started his service, stirred the fire, swept, and carried the dung behind the door, just as he was told. When the old devil came back, he checked if everything was done, was satisfied, and went out again. The soldier looked around and saw the cauldrons standing all around in hell, with a huge fire under them, and it was boiling and bubbling in them. He would have liked to look into them very much if the devil had not forbidden it so strictly. Finally, he could not resist any longer, lifted the lid of the first cauldron a little, and looked in. There he saw his former sergeant sitting inside: “Ah, bird, I catch you here? You had me, now I have you,” he quickly closed the lid, stirred the fire, and added more fuel. Then he went to the second cauldron, lifted the lid a little, and looked in. There sat his ensign inside: “Ah, bird, I catch you here? You had me, now I have you,” he closed the lid again and brought a log to add to the fire. Now he also wanted to see who was sitting in the third cauldron. There it was a general: “Ah, bird, I catch you here? You had me, now I have you,” he grabbed the bellows and made the hellish fire burn fiercely under him. So he served the devil for seven years in hell, did not wash himself, did not comb himself, did not snip, did not cut his nails or hair, and did not wipe his eyes with water. And the seven years seemed to him to be so short that he thought it was only half a year. When the time was finally up, the devil came and said, “Now, Hans, what have you done?” “I have stirred the fire under the cauldrons, I have swept and carried the dung behind the door,” “But you have also looked into the cauldrons; your luck is that you have added wood; otherwise, your life would have been lost. Now your time is up, do you want to go home?” “Yes,” said the soldier, “I would also like to see what my father is doing at home.” The devil said, “So that you get your deserved reward, go and fill your backpack with dung and take it with you. You should also go unwashed and uncombed, with long hair on your head and beard, with uncut nails and with dull eyes, and if you are asked where you come from, say ‘from hell’, and if you are asked who you are, say ‘the devil’s sooty brother, and my king too’.” The soldier remained silent and did as the devil said, but he was not satisfied with his reward at all. As soon as he was back in the woods, he lifted his backpack from his back and wanted to empty it. When he opened it, the dung had turned into pure gold. “I wouldn’t have thought that,” he said, and was happy, and went into the town. In front of the inn stood the innkeeper, and when he saw Hans coming, he was frightened because Hans looked so frightful, worse than a scarecrow. He called him over and asked, “Where are you from?” “From hell.” “Who are you?” “The devil’s sooty brother, and my king too.” The innkeeper did not want to let him in, but when Hans showed him the gold, he went and opened the door himself. Then Hans was given the best room and was treated royally, ate and drank himself full, but did not wash himself or comb himself, as the devil had ordered, and finally went to sleep. The innkeeper, however, could not stop looking at the backpack full of gold and did not get any rest until he crept in during the night and stole it. When Hans got up the next morning, he wanted to pay the innkeeper and continue on his way, but his backpack was gone. He took it calmly, thought, “You are unlucky without guilt,” and turned back, straight to hell: there he complained to the old devil about his misfortune and asked for help. The devil said, “Sit down, I will wash you, comb you, snip, cut your nails and hair, and wipe your eyes with water,” and when he had finished with him, he gave him the backpack again full of dung and said, “Go and tell the innkeeper that he should give you back your gold, otherwise I will come and take him away, and he should take your place and stir the fire.” Hans went up and said to the innkeeper, “You have stolen my gold, give it back to me, otherwise you will come to hell to my place and have to look as frightful as I do.” Then the innkeeper gave him the gold and even more besides, and begged him only to leave in peace. And Hans was now a rich man. Hans made his way home to his father, bought a poor linen shirt, and went around making music, because that was what he had learned from the devil in hell. But it was an old king in the land who had to be played to, and he was so delighted that he promised Hans his eldest daughter in marriage. But when the daughter heard that she was to marry such a common man in a white shirt, she said, “I would rather go into the deepest water.” Then the king gave her to Hans in marriage, and when the old king died, he also got the entire kingdom.
