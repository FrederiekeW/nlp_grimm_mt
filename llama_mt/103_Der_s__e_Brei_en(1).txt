Once upon a time there was a poor little girl, who lived with her mother alone, and they had nothing to eat. So the child went out into the wood, and there she came upon an old woman, who knew her sorrow already, and gave her a little pot, to which she said, 'Little pot, cook,' and it cooked her a good, sweet porridge, and when she said, 'Little pot, stand,' it stopped cooking. The child took the pot home to her mother, and now they were free from their poverty and hunger, and they ate sweet porridge as often as they wished.

One day the child went out, and the mother said, 'Little pot, cook,' and it cooked, and they ate and were satisfied; now she wanted the pot to stop cooking, but she did not know the word. So it went on cooking, and the porridge rose over the edge of the pot, and cooked on, filling the kitchen and the whole house, and the next house, and then the street, as if it would fill the whole world, and it was the greatest need, and no one knew how to help. At last, when only one house was left, the child came home, and said only, 'Little pot, stand,' and it stood still and stopped cooking; and whoever wanted to go into the town had to go through it. It was a great misfortune, and all the people said, 'It is a great misfortune, and it will not be repeated.'
