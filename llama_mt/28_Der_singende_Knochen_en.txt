Once upon a time in a land there was great lamentation about a wild boar that was plowing up the fields of the farmers, killing the livestock and tearing the bodies of the people with its tusks. The king promised a great reward to anyone who would free the land from this plague, but the animal was so large and strong that no one dared to approach the forest where it lived. Finally, the king announced that whoever caught or killed the wild boar would have his only daughter as his wife.

Two brothers lived in the land, sons of a poor man, who offered themselves and wanted to take on the risk. The oldest, who was clever and cunning, did it out of pride, the youngest, who was innocent and foolish, out of good intentions. The king said, "In order to find the animal more safely, you should go into the forest from opposite sides." So the oldest went in the evening and the youngest in the morning. And when the youngest had been walking for a while, a little man approached him, holding a black spear in his hand and said, "I give you this spear because your heart is innocent and good: with this you can go safely to the wild boar, it will not harm you." He thanked the little man, took the spear on his shoulder and went on without fear. Not long after, he saw the animal, which ran towards him, but he held the spear in front of it, and in its blind rage it ran so violently into it that its heart was cut in two. Then he took the beast on his shoulder and went home, intending to bring it to the king.

As he came out of the forest on the other side, there was a house at the entrance where people were having fun with dance and wine. His older brother had entered and thought that the boar would not run away from him, first he wanted to drink a good drink. When he saw the youngest coming out of the forest with his prey, his envious and malicious heart did not rest. He called out to him, "Come on in, dear brother, rest and strengthen yourself with a cup of wine." The youngest, who suspected nothing bad, went in and told him about the good little man who had given him a spear with which he had killed the boar. The oldest kept him back until evening, then they went out together. But when they came to the bridge over a stream in the darkness, the oldest made the youngest go ahead, and when he was in the middle of the water, he gave him a blow from behind, so that he fell dead. He buried him under the bridge, took the boar and brought it to the king, pretending that he had killed it, and as a reward he received the king's daughter as his wife. When the younger brother did not return, he said, "The boar must have torn his body apart," and everyone believed it.

But because nothing remains hidden before God, this black deed should also come to light. After many years, a shepherd once drove his flock over the bridge and saw a white bone lying in the sand and thought it would make a good mouthpiece. So he climbed down, picked it up and carved a mouthpiece out of it for his horn. When he blew on it for the first time, to his great surprise, the bone began to sing on its own:

"Oh, dear shepherd's staff,
you blow on my little bone,
my brother killed me,
beneath the bridge buried me,
for the king's little daughter."

"What a wonderful little horn," said the shepherd, "that sings by itself, I must bring it to the king." When he came to the king with it, the horn began to sing its little song again. The king understood it well, and had the earth under the bridge dug up, and the whole skeleton of the murdered man came to light. The wicked brother could not deny the deed, was sewn into a sack and drowned alive, the bones of the murdered man were placed in a beautiful grave on the churchyard. The king thanked the shepherd, and the horn was brought to the church, where it still stands today and is a wonderful little horn.
