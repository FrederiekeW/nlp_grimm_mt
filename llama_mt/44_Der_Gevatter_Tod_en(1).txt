There was a poor man who had twelve children and had to work day and night to give them only bread. When the thirteenth child was born, he did not know how to help himself, went out onto the big highway and wanted to ask the first person he met to be the child's godfather. The first person he met was God, who knew what was on his mind and said to him, “Poor man, you are calling on me, I will baptize your child, I will take care of it and make it happy on earth.” The man said, “Who are you?” “I am God.” “So I do not want you to be my child’s godfather,” said the man, “you give to the rich and leave the poor to starve.” The man said this because he did not know how wisely God distributes wealth and poverty. So he turned away from the Lord and went on. Then the devil came to him and said, “What are you looking for? Do you want me to be your child’s godfather, so I will give him gold and riches and all the pleasures of the world.” The man asked, “Who are you?” “I am the devil.” “So I do not want you to be my child’s godfather,” said the man, “you deceive and tempt people.” He went on, and then Death, who was thin and gaunt, came up to him and said, “Take me as your child’s godfather.” The man asked, “Who are you?” “I am Death, who makes all people equal.” Then the man said, “You are the right one, you take the rich and the poor without distinction, you shall be my child’s godfather.” Death replied, “I will make your child rich and famous, because whoever has me as a friend cannot lack anything.” The man said, “Next Sunday is the baptism, then you must be there at the right time.” Death appeared as he had promised and stood as a godfather.

When the child grew up, the godfather came to him one day and said, “Now you shall receive your godfather’s gift. I will make you a famous doctor. If you are called to a sick person, I will always appear: if I stand at the head of the sick person, you can speak boldly and say you will make them healthy again, and if you give them that herb, they will recover; but if I stand at the feet of the sick person, then it is my property, and you must say that all help is in vain and no doctor in the world can save them. But beware that you do not use the herb against my will, it could go badly for you.” It did not take long before the young man became the most famous doctor in the world. “He only needs to look at the sick person and he already knows if they will recover or if they will die,” so it was said about him, and people came from far and wide to call him to the sick and gave him so much gold that he soon became a rich man. Now it happened that the king fell ill: the doctor was called and should say if recovery was possible. But when he came to the bed, Death stood at the feet of the sick person, and there was no herb left for him. “If only I could outsmart Death,” thought the doctor, “he will certainly take it badly, but as my godfather, he will probably look the other way: I will take the risk.” So he took the sick person and turned him over so that Death stood at the head of the sick person. Then he gave him the herb, and the king recovered and became healthy again. Death came to the doctor and made a wicked and sinister face, threatened with his finger and said, “You have led me astray: this time I will take revenge on you, because you are my godfather, but if you do it again, you will be done for, and I will take you myself with me.”

Not long after, the king’s daughter fell seriously ill. She was his only child, he wept day and night, his eyes were blinded, and he announced that whoever saved her from death would become her husband and inherit the crown. The doctor, when he came to the bed of the sick person, saw Death at her feet. He should have remembered the warning of his godfather, but the great beauty of the king’s daughter and the prospect of becoming her husband blinded him so that he threw all his thoughts to the wind. He did not see that Death was giving him angry glances, raising his hand and threatening him with his dry fist; he lifted the sick person up and put her head where her feet had been, and then gave her the herb. As soon as he did this, her cheeks flushed and new life stirred in her.

Death, when he saw himself deceived for the second time, came up to the doctor with long strides and said, “It’s over with you and now it’s your turn.” He grabbed the doctor with his icy hand so hard that he could not resist, and led him to an underground cave. There he saw that thousands and thousands of lights were burning in endless rows, some big, some half-big, some small. Every moment some of them went out and others lit up again, so that the flames seemed to jump back and forth in constant change. “Do you see,” said Death, “these are the lights of human life. The big ones belong to children, the half-big ones to married people in their prime, the small ones to the elderly. But even children and young people often only have a small light.” “Show me my life light,” said the doctor, and he thought it was still quite big. Death pointed to a small end that was about to go out and said, “You see, there it is.” “Oh, dear godfather,” said the terrified doctor, “light a new one for me, do it out of love, so that I can enjoy my life, become king and husband of the beautiful king’s daughter.” “I cannot,” replied Death, “one must go out before a new one can be lit.” “So replace the old one with a new one that will burn out just as soon as the old one is gone,” begged the doctor. Death pretended to agree, reached for a fresh big light, but because he wanted to take revenge, he deliberately made a mistake and the small piece fell out and went out. Immediately the doctor fell to the ground, and was now himself in the hand of Death. “You have led me astray,” said Death, “now you are my property. So, you are now a shadow, something, nothing, a wretch, a ghost, a corpse, dust, a breath, a shadow, nothing.” Death pulled back his icy hand, and the doctor lay there and had become a shadow.

The king, who had recovered, demanded the doctor who had saved his daughter to be brought to him and made him marry the daughter, and the doctor, who had become a shadow, allowed himself to be crowned king. The wedding was very grand, but the doctor, who had become a shadow, saw with his own eyes how Death, who was sitting opposite him, put the crown on the king’s daughter’s head and gave her his hand. “It is good so,” said Death, “now you are my property, and I am your master. You are my shadow, and I am your master. I am your death, and you are my life.” Death laughed loudly and the whole assembly heard it, and soon the dance began.
