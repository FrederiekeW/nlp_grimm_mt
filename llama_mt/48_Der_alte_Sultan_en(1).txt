The farmer had a loyal dog named Sultan, who had grown old and lost all his teeth, so that he could no longer grip anything tightly. At one time, the farmer stood with his wife at the entrance to their house and said, “I shall shoot the old Sultan tomorrow, he is no longer of any use.” The wife, who had compassion for the faithful animal, replied, “Since he has served us for so many years and has been honest with us, we could perhaps give him the bread of mercy.” “Ah, what nonsense,” said the farmer, “you are not sensible: he has no teeth left in his mouth, and no thief is afraid of him; he can now go away. If he has served us, he has had his good food for it.”

The poor dog, who was lying not far away in the sun, had heard everything and was sad that tomorrow would be his last day. He had a good friend, the wolf, to whom he slipped out in the evening into the forest and complained about the fate that awaited him. “Hear me, uncle,” said the wolf, “be of good cheer, I will help you out of your distress. I have thought of something. Tomorrow, early in the morning, your master and his wife will go into the hay, and they will take their little child with them, because no one remains in the house. They usually put the child behind the hedge in the shade while they work: lie down next to it, as if you wanted to guard it. I will then come out of the forest and steal the child: you must eagerly chase after me, as if you wanted to drive it away from me. I will drop it, and you bring it back to the parents, who will then believe that you saved it and will be so grateful that they will not harm you, but rather show you mercy, and they will provide for you as long as you live.”

The plan pleased the dog, and it was carried out just as it had been devised. The father shouted when he saw the wolf with the child running through the field, but when the old Sultan brought the child back, he was happy, stroked him, and said, “You shall not lose a single hair, you shall eat the bread of mercy as long as you live.” To his wife, he said, “Go home immediately and cook the old Sultan a warm porridge, he does not need to bite, and bring out my pillow from my bed, I give it to him as a cushion.”

From then on, the old Sultan had it as good as he could have wished. Soon after, the wolf visited him and was pleased that everything had gone so well. “But, uncle,” he said, “you will surely turn a blind eye if, on some occasion, I take a fat sheep from your master. It is difficult to make a living these days.” “Do not count on it,” replied the dog, “I will remain loyal to my master, I may not betray him.” The wolf thought this was not said in earnest, came at night and wanted to steal the sheep. But the farmer, whom the loyal Sultan had betrayed the wolf’s plan, was watching and combed him with the flail, very unpleasantly. The wolf had to run away, and he shouted to the dog, “Wait, you scoundrel, you will pay for it.”

The next morning, the wolf sent the wild boar, and summoned the dog to come out into the forest to settle their score. The old Sultan could find no other help than a cat with three legs, and when they went out together, the poor cat hobbled along and stretched its tail high up in pain. The wolf and his companion were already at the scene when they saw their opponent coming, and they thought he was carrying a sword with him, because they saw the raised tail of the cat. And when the cat hopped along on three legs, they thought it was picking up a stone to throw at them. Both of them were afraid: the wild boar hid in the underbrush, and the wolf jumped onto a tree. The dog and the cat came closer, and they wondered why no one was visible. But the wild boar had not completely hidden itself, and its ears were still sticking out. While the cat was cautiously looking around, the boar twitched its ears: the cat thought it was a mouse and jumped on it and bit it hard. Then the boar arose with a loud cry and ran away, shouting, “There on the tree is the culprit.” The dog and the cat looked up and saw the wolf, who was ashamed of having shown such cowardice and took peace with the dog. The dog was happy, because he was now in complete harmony with the wolf.
