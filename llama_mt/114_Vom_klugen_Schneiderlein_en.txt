Once upon a time there was a princess who was incredibly proud: if a suitor came, she would give him something to think about, and if he couldn’t solve it, he would be sent away with scorn. She also had it announced that whoever solved the riddle would marry her, and whoever wanted to come should come. Finally, three tailors came together, of whom the two oldest thought they had made many fine stitches and had hit their mark, so they wouldn’t miss here either; the third was a small, useless rascal who didn’t even know his trade, but thought he would have to be lucky, because he didn’t know where else it would come from. The two others said to him, “Stay at home, you won’t get far with your little understanding.” But the little tailor was not deterred and said he had once put his head on the line and wanted to help himself, and went there as if the whole world belonged to him.

The three of them presented themselves to the princess and said she should present her riddle: they were the right people who had come, they had a fine understanding that could be wound up in a needle. The princess said, “I have two hairs on my head, what color are they?” “If it’s nothing more,” said the first, “it will be black and white, like the cloth called Kümmel and Salz.” The princess said, “You have solved it incorrectly, answer the second.” The second said, “It’s not black and white, it’s brown and red, like my lord’s father’s roast coat.” “You have solved it incorrectly,” said the princess, “answer the third, I see that he will certainly know it.” Then the little tailor stepped forward boldly and said, “The princess has a silver and a golden hair on her head, and those are the two colors.” When the princess heard this, she turned pale and almost fell over with fright, because the little tailor had solved it, and she had thought that no one in the world would be able to come up with it. When her heart came back to her, she said, “You haven’t won me yet, you still have to do something else, there is a bear in the stable below, you have to spend the night with it; if I wake up tomorrow and you are still alive, I will marry you.” But she thought that with this she would get rid of the little tailor, because the bear had never left a living human who had come under its paws.

The little tailor was not deterred and said, “Freshly ventured is half won.” When the evening came, the little tailor was taken down to the bear. The bear wanted to attack the little tailor right away and give him a welcome with its paw. “Gently, gently,” said the little tailor, “I will calm you down.” Then he pulled out walnuts from his pocket, bit into them, and ate the kernels. When the bear saw this, it became interested and wanted to have nuts too. The little tailor pulled out a handful of nuts and gave them to the bear, but they were actually Wackersteine (a type of stone). The bear tried to bite them, but couldn’t break them open, no matter how hard it tried. “Ah,” thought the bear, “what a stupid blockhead you are! You can’t even bite the nut open.” The bear said to the little tailor, “Come on, bite the nuts open for me.” “You see what kind of fellow you are,” said the little tailor, “you have such a big mouth and can’t even bite the small nut open.” Then the little tailor took the stones and quickly replaced them with a walnut, and it cracked open. “I have to try that again,” said the bear, “if I see it, I think I can do it too.” The little tailor gave the bear Wackersteine again, and the bear worked and bit into them with all its might. But you don’t believe that it was able to break them open. When that was done, the little tailor pulled out a violin from under his coat and played a little piece on it. When the bear heard the music, it couldn’t help itself and started to dance, and when it had danced for a while, it enjoyed it so much that it said to the little tailor, “Hey, is playing the violin difficult?” “Child’s play,” said the little tailor, “look, with my left hand I put the fingers on and with my right hand I stroke the bow on, and it goes along, hop-sa, vivalla-lera!” “So, playing the violin,” said the bear, “I would like to learn that too, so that I can dance whenever I feel like it. What do you think? Will you teach me?” “With all my heart,” said the little tailor, “if you have the talent for it. But know that your paws are very long, I have to trim your nails a bit.” A vice was brought, and the bear placed its paws on it, and the little tailor tightened them and said, “Now wait until I come with the scissors,” he let the bear bray as much as it wanted, laid himself down in the corner on a bundle of straw, and fell asleep.

The princess, when she heard the bear braying loudly in the evening, thought it was braying with joy and would have done the little tailor in. In the morning, she was quite carefree and cheerful, but when she looks out into the stable, she sees the little tailor standing there quite cheerfully and healthy as a fish in water. Then she couldn’t say anything against it anymore, because she had publicly promised it, and the king had a carriage brought, in which she had to ride with the little tailor to the church and marry him. When they got in, the two other tailors, who had a false heart and didn’t want to give him his luck, went into the stable and loosened the bear. The bear, in full fury, ran after the carriage. The princess heard it snorting and braying: it scared her, and she cried, “Oh, the bear is behind us and wants to get you!” The little tailor was quick, stood on his head, stretched his legs out the window, and cried, “Do you see the vice? If you don’t go, you’ll have to go back in!” When the bear saw this, it turned around and ran away. The little tailor rode calmly to the church, and the princess was married to him, and she lived with him happily like a heathen. If you don’t believe it, pay a thaler.
