Once upon a time there was an old queen, a sorceress, who had a daughter as beautiful as the sun. The old queen thought only of how she could lure people to their downfall, and whenever a suitor came, she would say that whoever wanted to have her daughter would first have to solve a riddle or die. Many were blinded by the beauty of the maiden and dared to try, but they could not accomplish what the old queen had set before them, and then there was no mercy, they had to kneel down, and their heads were cut off. A prince who had also heard of the great beauty of the maiden spoke to his father, "Let me go, I want to woo her." "Never," replied the king, "if you go, you will go to your death." The son then lay down and fell ill, and lay for seven years, and no doctor could help him. When the father saw that there was no hope, he said with a heavy heart, "Go and try your luck, I do not know how to help you." When the son heard this, he got up from his bed, became well again, and set off with joy.

It happened that as he was riding over a heath, he saw from a distance something lying on the ground like a large haystack, and as he approached, he could see that it was the belly of a man who had stretched himself out on the ground; the belly looked like a small mountain. The fat man, as he saw the traveler, sat up and said, "If you need anyone, take me into your service." The prince replied, "What am I to do with a man as ugly as you?" "Oh," said the fat man, "that means nothing, for if I stretch myself out properly, I am still three thousand times thicker." "If that is the case," said the prince, "I can use you, come with me." The fat man followed the prince, and after a while they found another man who lay on the ground and had his ear on the grass. The prince asked, "What are you doing?" "I am listening," replied the man. "What are you listening to so intently?" "I am listening to what is happening in the world, for my ears do not miss anything, not even the grass growing." The prince asked, "Tell me, what do you hear at the old queen's court, where the beautiful daughter lives?" The man replied, "I hear the sword cutting off the head of a suitor." The prince said, "I can use you, come with me." They continued on their way and saw a man lying on the ground with his legs visible, but the rest of him was not visible. After a while, they came to the man's body and finally to his head. "Ah," said the prince, "what a long rope you are!" "Oh," replied the man, "that is nothing, for if I stretch myself out properly, I am still three thousand times longer, and I am taller than the highest mountain on earth. I would be happy to serve you if you would accept me." "Come with me," said the prince, "I can use you." They continued on their way and found a man sitting by the road with his eyes bandaged. The prince said to him, "Do you have blind eyes that you cannot see the light?" "No," replied the man, "I am not allowed to remove the bandage, for what I see with my eyes is so terrifying that it would spring out of its place, for my gaze is so powerful." "If that is the case," said the prince, "I can use you, come with me." They continued on their way and found a man who lay in the hot sunlight and shivered and froze all over, so that not a limb was still. "How can you freeze?" asked the prince, "and the sun is shining so warmly?" "Ah," replied the man, "my nature is quite different, the hotter it is, the more I freeze, and the colder it is, the hotter I become. I can hardly bear it in the middle of the ice, and in the middle of the fire I cannot bear it either." "You are a strange fellow," said the prince, "but if you want to serve me, come with me." They continued on their way and saw a man standing who stretched his neck and looked around and over all the mountains. The prince asked, "What are you looking at so intently?" The man replied, "I have such sharp eyes that I can see over all the forests and fields, valleys and mountains, and through the whole world." The prince said, "I would like you to come with me, for someone like you is still missing." The prince and his six servants then entered the city where the old queen lived. The prince did not say who he was, but said, "If you want to give me your beautiful daughter, I will accomplish what you have set before me." The sorceress was delighted that such a handsome young man had fallen into her nets again and said, "I will give you three tasks to complete, if you solve each one, you will become the master and husband of my daughter." "What is the first task?" asked the prince. "You must bring me a ring that I lost in the red sea," said the sorceress. The prince went back to his servants and said, "The first task is not easy, a ring must be brought from the red sea, now let us think of a plan." The man with the sharp eyes said, "I will see where it is," looked into the sea and said, "it is hanging on a sharp rock." The long man carried them to the sea and said, "I would like to pull it out, if I could only see it." "If that is all," said the fat man, "I will take care of it," and he lay down and held his mouth to the water, and the waves fell into it like a precipice, and he drank the whole sea dry, so that it was as dry as a meadow. The long man bent down a little and pulled the ring out of the water with his hand. The prince was overjoyed when he had the ring and brought it to the old queen. She was amazed and said, "Yes, it is the right ring, you have solved the first task, but now comes the second." "Do you see the meadow in front of my castle, where three hundred fat oxen are grazing? You must eat them all, skin and bones, horns and hair, and drink three hundred barrels of wine to go with it; and if even one hair of the oxen or a drop of wine remains, your life will be forfeit." The prince said, "Can I invite some guests to join me? Without company, no meal is enjoyable." The old queen laughed wickedly and replied, "You may invite one guest, so you will have company, but no one else." The prince went back to his servants and said to the fat man, "You will be my guest today and eat one of the oxen, so you can get a good meal." The fat man stretched himself out and ate the three hundred oxen, so that not a hair was left, and asked if there was anything else to eat. He drank the wine out of the barrels without needing a glass, and drank the last drop from the nail. When the meal was over, the prince went back to the old queen and said, "The second task has been solved." She was amazed and said, "No one has ever come this far, but there is still one task left," and thought, "you will not escape me, and you will not keep your head." "Tonight," said she, "I will bring my daughter to your chamber, and you must hug her with your arms; and when you are sitting together, be careful not to fall asleep: I will come at midnight, and if she is not still in your arms, you will lose." The prince thought, "The task is easy, I will certainly keep my eyes open," but he called his servants and told them what the old queen had said, and said, "We do not know what trickery is behind it, caution is good, keep watch and make sure the maiden does not leave my chamber again." When night fell, the old queen came with her daughter and led her to the prince's arms, and then the long man wrapped himself around them both in a circle, and the fat man stood in front of the door, so that no living soul could get in. They sat there, and the maiden said nothing, but the moon shone through the window onto her face, so that her wonderful beauty could be seen. The prince did nothing but look at her, was full of joy and love, and no tiredness came into his eyes. This lasted until eleven o'clock, when the old queen cast a spell over them all, and they fell asleep, and in that moment the maiden was taken away. They slept soundly until a quarter to twelve, when the spell was powerless, and they awoke again. "Oh, woe and misfortune!" cried the prince, "now I am lost!" The faithful servants also began to lament, but the listener said, "Be quiet, I will listen," and listened for a moment, then said, "she sits in a rock three hundred leagues away, and is lamenting her fate. You alone can help, Long Man, if you stand up, you will be there in a few steps." "Yes," replied the long man, "but the man with the sharp eyes must come with me, so we can move the rock." The long man picked up the man with the bandaged eyes and in an instant they were standing in front of the cursed rock. The long man removed the bandage from the man's eyes, and in an instant, as one turns a hand, they were standing in front of the rock. The long man then took the maiden on his arm and carried her back in an instant, and also brought the other servant back, and before it was twelve o'clock, they were all sitting again as before, and were merry and in good spirits. When it struck twelve, the old queen came sneaking up, made a mocking face, as if to say, "now it is mine," and thought her daughter was three hundred leagues away in the rock. But when she saw her daughter in the prince's arms, she was frightened and said, "there is someone who can do more than I." But she could not object and had to give her daughter to the prince. Then she whispered to her daughter, "Shame on you, that you must obey common people and cannot choose your husband to your liking." The proud heart of the maiden was filled with anger and she plotted revenge. She had three hundred bundles of wood brought together and said to the prince, "the three tasks have been solved, I will not become your wife until one of you is willing to sit in the middle of the wood and endure the fire." She thought that none of her servants would be willing to burn for him, and out of love for her, he would sit in the wood himself, and then she would be free. The servants, however, said, "we have all done something, only the Frosty one has not, he must do it too," and they set him in the middle of the wood and lit the fire. The fire burned for three days, until all the wood was consumed, and when the flames died down, the Frosty one stood in the middle of the ashes, shivering like a willow leaf and said, "I have never endured such a frost in my life, and if it had lasted any longer, I would have frozen stiff." There was no hope left, and the beautiful maiden had to take the unknown young man as her husband. When they went to the church, the old queen said, "I cannot bear the shame," and sent her warriors to destroy everything that stood in their way and bring back her daughter. The listener, however, had his ears open and had heard the old queen's secret talks. "What shall we do?" he asked the fat man, but the fat man knew what to do, and spat once or twice behind the wagon, spitting out some of the sea water he had drunk, and a great sea appeared, in which the warriors were stuck and drowned. When the old queen heard this, she sent her armored knights, but the listener heard the clanking of their armor and tied the eyes of one of them, who looked at the enemy with a sharp eye, and they sprang apart like glass. They then continued on their way unimpeded, and when the two were married in the church, the six servants took their leave and said to their master, "your wishes are fulfilled, you no longer need us, we will continue our journey and try our luck." Half an hour before the castle, there was a village, where a shepherd was watching his flock. As they passed by, he said to his wife, "do you know who I am? I am not a prince, but a shepherd, and the one with the flock is my father: we two must also endure it and help him to watch." Then he went with her into the inn, and said secretly to the innkeeper, "in the night, take away the prince's royal clothes." When she awoke the next morning, she had nothing to do, and the innkeeper gave her an old dress and a pair of old woolen stockings, saying, "if not your husband were a shepherd, I would not have given them to you." She believed he was really a shepherd and was watching the flock with him, and thought, "I have deserved it with my pride and arrogance." This lasted for eight days, until her feet were sore. Then some people came and asked if she knew who her husband was. "Yes," she replied, "he is a shepherd, and he has just gone out to trade with ribbons and strings." They said, "come with us, we will show you where he is," and brought her to the castle, and when she entered the great hall, her husband was standing there in royal clothes. She did not recognize him until he hugged her, kissed her, and said, "I have suffered so much for you, you should also have suffered for me." Now the wedding was celebrated, and he who told the story says he would have been there too.
