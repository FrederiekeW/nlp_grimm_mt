Once upon a time, there was a young fellow who had learned the locksmith trade and said to his father, ‘I want to go out into the world and try my luck.’ ‘Yes,’ said the father, ‘I am satisfied with that’ and gave him some money for the journey. So he wandered around and looked for work. One day, when he was no longer able to follow the locksmith trade and was no longer suited for it, he got a taste for hunting. As he was on the road, he met a hunter in a green cloak, who asked him where he came from and where he was going. ‘I am a locksmith’s apprentice,’ said the young fellow, ‘but the trade no longer suits me, and I have a taste for hunting. Do you want to take me on as an apprentice?’ ‘Yes, if you want to go with me.’ So the young fellow went with him, rented himself out to him for several years, and learned the art of hunting. After that, he wanted to try his luck again, and the hunter gave him nothing but a wind-blowing gun, which had the property that whenever he fired it, it would hit its mark with certainty. So he went on his way and came to a very large forest, from which he could not find the end in a day. As evening approached, he sat down on a high tree to avoid the wild beasts. Around midnight, he thought he saw a small light in the distance, so he looked through the branches and kept an eye on it. But he took his hat off first and threw it after the light down, so that he could follow it when he had climbed down. As he climbed down, he went after his hat, put it back on, and continued on his way straight ahead. The further he went, the bigger the light became, and when he got closer, he saw that it was a huge fire, and there were three giants sitting by it, with an ox on the spit and roasting it. Now one of them said, ‘I must try whether the meat is ready to eat,’ pulled a piece off and wanted to put it in his mouth, but the hunter shot it out of his hand. ‘Well, then,’ said the giant, ‘the wind must have blown it out of my hand,’ and took another piece. As he was about to take a bite, the hunter shot it out of his hand again; then the giant gave the one next to him a slap on the face and shouted angrily, ‘What are you taking my piece away from me?’ ‘I didn’t take it away,’ said the other, ‘it must have been shot out of your hand by a sharpshooter.’ The giant took the third piece, but couldn’t hold onto it, the hunter shot it out of his hand again. Then the giants said, ‘This must be a good marksman, who shoots the piece out of the mouth before it’s even bitten. We could use someone like that.’ And they shouted loudly, ‘Come here, you sharpshooter, sit down with us by the fire and eat your fill, we won’t do you any harm. But if you don’t come and we have to get you by force, you’re lost.’ So the young fellow came up and said he was a skilled hunter, and that he could hit his mark with his gun, no matter what he aimed at. ‘Yes, if you want to go with us,’ said they, ‘you’ll be well taken care of.’ They told him that there was a large castle behind a great lake, and in the castle was a beautiful princess who they wanted to kidnap. ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘I’ll get her out of there soon enough.’ They said, ‘But there’s something else – there’s a small dog there that starts barking as soon as anyone approaches, and as soon as it barks, the whole castle wakes up. And that’s why we can’t get in.’ ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘I’ll take care of the dog.’ They said, ‘But you have to kill it.’ ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘that’s no problem.’ So he set off, got into a ship, and crossed the lake. As he got closer to the shore, the little dog came running and started barking, but he got his wind-blowing gun and shot it dead. When the giants saw this, they were overjoyed and thought they had the princess in the bag. But the hunter wanted to see how things stood, and said they should wait outside until he called them in. So he went into the castle, and it was completely quiet inside, and everyone was asleep. When he opened the first room, he saw a sword hanging on the wall, made of pure silver, with a golden star on it and the king’s name on it. Next to it was a sealed letter, which he broke open, and it said that whoever had the sword could kill anyone he wanted. He took the sword down, hung it around his neck, and continued on his way. He came to the princess’s room, where she was sleeping, and she was so beautiful that he stood still and looked at her and held his breath. He thought to himself, ‘How can I bring an innocent princess into the clutches of those wild giants, who have evil intentions?’ He looked around and saw that under the bed were a pair of slippers, with the king’s name on the right one and the princess’s name on the left. She was also wearing a large silk scarf with gold embroidery, with the king’s name on the right side and her own name on the left. He took a pair of scissors and cut off the right slipper and put it in his bag, and then he took the right slipper with the king’s name and put it in his bag as well. He then cut off a piece of the princess’s dress and put it in his bag, but he did all this without touching her. Then he left her alone and let her sleep, and when he came back to the door, the giants were still waiting outside, thinking he would bring the princess. He called out to them, ‘You should come in, the princess is already in my possession.’ But he said he couldn’t open the door for them, but there was a hole in it that they would have to crawl through. The first giant came closer, and the hunter wrapped his hair around his hand, pulled his head through the hole, and struck him with his sword and cut off his head in one blow. He then pulled the giant through the hole and left him there. He called out to the second giant and did the same to him, and finally to the third, and was happy that he had freed the beautiful princess from her enemies. He then cut out their tongues and put them in his bag. He thought to himself, ‘I’ll go back to my father and show him what I’ve done, and then I’ll go out into the world and see what luck I can find.’ The king in the castle, when he woke up, saw the three giants lying dead. He went into the princess’s room, woke her up, and asked who it could have been that killed the giants. She said, ‘Dear father, I don’t know, I was asleep.’ When she got up and tried to put on her slippers, the right one was missing, and when she looked at her scarf, it had been cut, and a piece of her dress was missing. The king called together all the courtiers and soldiers, and asked who had freed the princess and killed the giants. A one-eyed and ugly captain said, ‘I did it.’ The old king said, ‘If you did it, you should marry my daughter.’ The princess said, ‘Dear father, I’d rather go out into the world than marry that man.’ The king said, ‘If you don’t want to marry him, you should take off your royal clothes and put on peasant clothes and leave.’ And he should go to a potter and start a business with earthenware. The princess took off her royal clothes and went to a potter and borrowed some earthenware. She promised to pay him back the next day. The king ordered her to sit at a corner of the market and sell the earthenware, and he had several peasant carts sent to drive through the market, so that everything would be broken to pieces. When the princess had set up her stall and the carts were coming, she started to cry and said, ‘Oh God, how will I pay the potter back?’ The king had wanted to force her to marry the captain, but instead she went back to the potter and asked if he would lend her the earthenware again. He said no, she had to pay him back first. So she went back to her father and cried and begged, saying she wanted to go out into the world. The king said, ‘I’ll build a little house for you in the forest, where you can live and cook for everyone, but you can’t take any money.’ When the house was finished, a sign was hung outside the door that said, ‘Today for free, tomorrow for money.’ The princess sat there for a long time, and soon the news spread throughout the world that there was a princess who cooked for free, and that was written on a sign outside her door. The hunter heard about it and thought, ‘That would be something for you, you’re poor and have no money.’ So he took his wind-blowing gun and his bag, which still had all the things he had taken from the castle as souvenirs, and went into the forest and found the little house with the sign. He had his sword, with which he had cut off the giants’ heads, slung over his shoulder, and went into the house. He was given something to eat, and he was delighted with the beautiful princess, who was also very beautiful. She asked where he came from and where he was going, and he said, ‘I’m traveling the world.’ She asked him where he got his sword, and he said, ‘It’s got the king’s name on it.’ She asked if she was the king’s daughter, and he said, ‘Yes, you are.’ He then showed her the tongues of the giants, the slipper, the scarf, and the piece of dress, and she was overjoyed and said, ‘You’re the one who freed me.’ So they went together to the old king and brought him there, and the princess led him to her room and said, ‘This is the hunter who freed me.’ And when the old king saw all the souvenirs, he couldn’t doubt it and said, ‘I’m glad to know how everything went, and you should marry my daughter.’ The princess was overjoyed and said, ‘Yes, I’ll marry him.’ So they got married, and the king had a feast prepared. When they sat down to eat, the one-eyed captain sat next to the princess on the left, and the hunter sat next to her on the right. The captain thought the hunter was a stranger who had come to visit. After they had eaten and drunk, the old king said to the captain, ‘I want to give you something, but you have to guess what it is. If someone says he killed three giants, and you’re asked where the giants’ tongues are, and you have to look, and if you don’t find any in their heads, how did it happen?’ The captain said, ‘They must not have had any.’ ‘No,’ said the king, ‘every animal has a tongue.’ And he asked what the value was that he had suffered. The captain said, ‘He should be torn into pieces.’ The king said, ‘You’ve judged yourself, and you should be torn into pieces.’ So the captain was arrested and torn into four pieces, and the princess and the hunter got married. After the old king’s death, the hunter inherited the kingdom, and he lived with his wife and had a son, who was a fine young man. They lived in happiness and love.
