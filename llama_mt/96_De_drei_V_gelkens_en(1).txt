It is a thousand and more years ago, when here in the land there were small kings, who also had one living on the Keuterberg (a hill), who went out hunting. As now with his hunters from the castle, he was out in the forest, and under the mountains three maids were guarding their cows, and when he saw the king with so many people, the eldest of them said to the other two, "Hello, hello, if I get the king, I won't give him up." The second one replied from the other side of the mountain, and said to the one who was the king's right-hand man, "Hello, hello, if I get the king, I won't give him up." The youngest one replied, and said to the one who was the king's left-hand man, "Hello, hello, if I get the king, I won't give him up." But these were the two ministers. The king heard everything and, as he came back from the hunt, he had the three maids come to him and asked them what they had said to each other yesterday on the mountain. They refused to say anything, but the king asked the eldest if they wanted to take revenge on the man. She said yes, and her two sisters asked the two ministers, since they were all three beautiful and fair-faced, especially the queen, who had hair like silk.

The two sisters, however, did not have any children, and when the king had to travel far away, he had them come to the queen, so that they could be comforted, since she was already pregnant. She gave birth to a little boy, who had a red star on his forehead. The two sisters saw each other and wanted to throw the handsome boy into the water. As they threw him into the Weser river, a little bird flew up into the air, and sank:

"Tom Daude bereit,
up wietern Bescheid
tom Lilienstrus:
wacker Junge, bist du’s?"

(The bird is saying: "Tom Daude (the boy) is ready, up to the next message, to Lilienstrus (the king's court): brave boy, are you that one?")

When the two sisters heard this, they were frightened and ran away. When the king came home, he saw that the queen had given birth to a dog. The king said, "What God does, that is well done."

But a fisherman at the river had caught the little boy again, as he was still alive, and took him to his wife, who did not have any children, and they fed him. After a year, the king had to travel again, and the queen gave birth to a boy again, which the two false sisters threw into the water. The bird flew up into the air again and sank:

"Tom Daude bereit,
up wietern Bescheid
tom Lilienstrus:
wacker Junge, bist du’s?"

And when the king came back, he saw that the queen had given birth to a dog again, and he said again, "What God does, that is well done." But the fisherman pulled the boy out of the water again and took him.

Again, the king had to travel, and the queen gave birth to a girl, which the two false sisters threw into the water. The bird flew up into the air again and sank:

"Tom Daude bereit,
up wietern Bescheid
tom Lilienstrus:
wacker Mäken, bist du’s?"

And when the king came home, he saw that the queen had given birth to a cat. The king was angry and had his wife put in prison, where she had to stay for a long time.

The children were raised in secret, and one day the eldest went out with other boys to fish, and they did not want to share the fish with the other boys, and they said, "You foundling, go your way." The eldest was very sad and asked the old fisherman if that was true. The fisherman told him that he had once fished and had pulled him out of the water. The eldest said he wanted to go and find his father, but the fisherman begged him to stay, but he would not listen until the fisherman finally gave in. The eldest then went on his way and continued for many days, until he finally came to a great, mighty river, where an old woman was fishing. "Good day, mother," said the boy. "Thank you." "You must fish for a long time before you catch a fish," said the old woman. "And you must search for a long time before you find your father." "How did you come over the water?" asked the boy. "Ah, that only God knows," said the old woman. The old woman then took the boy on her back and carried him across the water, and he searched for a long time but could not find his father. After a year had passed, the second son also left and wanted to find his brother. He came to the same river and had the same experience as his brother. Only the daughter was left at home, who was so sad about her brothers that she begged the fisherman to take her with him, so that she could search for her brothers. The fisherman agreed, and she came to the same river, where the old woman was still fishing. "Good day, mother," said the girl. "Thank you." "God help you with your fishing," said the old woman. When the old woman heard this, she became friendly and took the girl across the water and gave her a rod, and said to her, "Now go on your way, my daughter, and when you come to a big black dog, you must be quiet and still and not laugh or kick, and then go on. Then you will come to a big open pit, where you must drop the rod and go straight through the pit to the other side; there is an old well, where a big tree has grown, and on the tree hangs a bird in a cage, take the bird out: then take a glass of water from the well and go back the same way; on the way back, drop the rod again and when you come to the dog, hit it in the face, but do not step on it, and then go back home." The girl followed the old woman's instructions and found her brothers on the way back, who had been searching for each other all over the world. They walked together until they came to the black dog, which the girl hit in the face, and it turned into a handsome prince, who went with them until they came to the river. There, the old woman was still fishing, and she asked herself who these people were, and took them all across the water, and then disappeared. The other two went back to the old fisherman, and they were all happy to have found each other again, and they hung the bird on the wall.

The second son, however, could not rest at home and took a bow and went out hunting. When he was out, he took his flute and made a little tune. The king, who was also out hunting, heard it and came over, and when he saw the boy, he said, "Who is this boy here, out hunting?" "Nobody," replied the boy. "Who do you hear?" "I am the fisherman's son." "You don't have any children." "If you don't believe me, come with me." The king followed the boy and asked the fisherman, who told him everything, and the bird on the wall began to sing:

"The mother sits alone,
in the little prison.
Oh, king, noble blood,
these are your children, God.
The two false sisters
caused the children's suffering,
in the water's depths,
where they found the fisherman."

The king and all the people were shocked, and the king took the bird, the fisherman, and the three children with him to the castle and released the queen from prison, who was very weak and ill. He gave the daughter a drink from the well, and she became healthy and strong again. The two false sisters were burned, and the daughter asked the prince, "Oh, prince, I am so happy to see you again." "Yes, mother, I am also happy to see you again." "Well, well, well, I will always love you." "Yes, mother, I will always love you." "Oh, prince, how did you come to leave?" "Yes, mother, I left when I was under the fisherman, and under his wife, and under the great water, and under the old woman, who took me out of the world. She gave me a rod, and took me to an old well, and took me through a big pit to the other side, and gave me a glass of water, and took me back the same way, and told me to hit the dog in the face, and then to come back home." "Oh, prince, I will always love you, well, well, well." "Yes, mother, I will always love you, well, well, well."

And so the two false sisters were burned, and the king took the children to himself and was happy that they had found each other again.
