There was once a soldier who had faithfully served the king for many years. When the war was over and the soldier, who had received many wounds, could no longer serve, the king spoke to him: "You may return home, I no longer need you. You will receive no more pay, for only those who serve me shall receive it." The soldier did not know how to support himself, and he went away full of worries, walking the entire day until he came to a forest in the evening. As the darkness fell, he saw a light and approached it, coming to a house where a witch lived. "Give me a place to rest and some food and drink," he said to her, "otherwise I will perish." "Oh no!" replied the witch, "who gives a lost soldier anything? But I will be merciful and take you in, if you do what I ask." "What do you want?" asked the soldier. "I want you to dig up my garden tomorrow," said the witch. The soldier agreed and worked hard the next day, but he could not finish before evening. "I see," said the witch, "that you cannot do any more today. I will keep you another night, and you shall do a task for me tomorrow. You must split and prepare a faggot of wood." The soldier needed the entire day for this, and in the evening the witch suggested that he stay another night. "You shall do a small task for me tomorrow," she said. "Behind my house is an old, dry well, and in it has fallen a blue light that burns and does not go out. You must bring it back up to me." The next day, the witch took the soldier to the well and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light and made a sign to have her pull him back up. She pulled him up, and as he was near the edge, she reached out her hand to take the blue light from him. "No," he said, and noticing her evil thoughts, "I will not give it to you until I am standing with both feet on the ground." The witch became angry, let him fall back into the well, and left.

The poor soldier fell without injury onto the wet ground, and the blue light continued to burn, but what good did that do him? He saw that he would not escape death. He sat there for a while, sad, and then he happened to reach into his pocket and found his half-smoked pipe. "This will be your last pleasure," he thought, and took it out, lit it with the blue light, and began to smoke. As the smoke wafted through the cavern, a small, black man suddenly appeared before him and asked, "Sir, what do you command?" "What do you have to do with me?" replied the soldier, surprised. "I must do everything you command," said the little man. "Good," said the soldier, "then help me out of this well." The little man took him by the hand and led him through an underground passage, not forgetting the blue light. He showed him the treasures that the witch had collected and hidden, and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above ground, the soldier said to the little man, "Now go, bind the old witch and bring her before the court." Not long after, the witch came on a wild cat, screaming terribly, and rode past like the wind. Soon after, the little man returned, saying, "It's all taken care of," and "the witch is already hanging from the gallows." "Sir, what do you command next?" asked the little man. "Not now," replied the soldier, "you can go home, but be ready to come to me whenever I call." "There's no need," said the little man, "all you need to do is light your pipe with the blue light, and I will be there immediately." With that, he disappeared before the soldier's eyes.

The soldier returned to the city from which he had come. He went to the best inn and had himself made fine clothes. Then he ordered the innkeeper to prepare a room as luxurious as possible. When it was finished and the soldier had moved in, he called the little man and said, "I have faithfully served the king, but he has sent me away and left me to starve. Now I want to take my revenge." "What shall I do?" asked the little man. "Late at night, when the king's daughter is asleep, bring her here, and she shall do maid's work for me." The little man said, "That's an easy task for me, but a dangerous one for you. If it gets out, you will be in trouble." When it was midnight, the door opened, and the little man carried the king's daughter in. "Ah, are you here?" cried the soldier, "get to work! Go, get the broom and sweep the room!" When she had finished, he told her to come to his armchair, stretched out his feet, and said, "Take off my boots." He threw them at her face, and she had to pick them up, clean them, and make them shine. She did everything he told her to do, without resistance, silently, and with half-closed eyes. At the first cock's crow, the little man carried her back to the king's castle and into her bed.

The next morning, the king's daughter went to her father and told him that she had had a strange dream. "I was carried through the streets at lightning speed and brought to a soldier's room, where I had to do maid's work and serve him, and do all sorts of menial tasks, sweeping the room and polishing the boots. It was just a dream, but I am so tired as if I had really done everything." "The dream may have been real," said the king, "I will give you some advice. Fill your pocket with beans and make a small hole in the pocket. If you are carried away again, the beans will fall out and leave a trail on the street." As the king spoke, the little man was standing there, invisible, and listening to everything.

That night, when the little man carried the king's daughter away again, some beans did fall out of her pocket, but they could not leave a trail, because the little man had scattered beans all over the streets beforehand. The king's daughter had to do maid's work again until the cock's crow.

The king sent his people out the next morning to search for the trail, but it was in vain, because the children in the streets were picking up the beans and saying, "It rained beans last night." "We must think of something else," said the king, "keep your shoe on when you go to bed, and before you return, hide one of them; I will find it." The little man heard the plan and, when the soldier asked him to bring the king's daughter again, he advised him against it, saying that there was no way to avoid the plan, and if the shoe was found, it could lead to trouble for the soldier. "Do what I tell you," replied the soldier, and the king's daughter had to do maid's work again that night, hiding a shoe under the bed before she was carried away.

The next morning, the king had the entire city search for the shoe, and it was found at the soldier's place. The soldier himself, who had gone out the door on the little man's advice, was soon caught and thrown into prison. He had forgotten his best possessions, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat left in his pocket. When he stood at the window of his cell, chained, he saw one of his comrades pass by. He knocked on the glass, and when he came, he said, "Do me a favor and fetch the little bundle I left in the inn, I'll give you a ducat for it." The comrade ran and brought it back. As soon as the soldier was alone, he lit his pipe and called the little man. "Don't be afraid," said the little man to his master, "go wherever they take you, and let everything happen. Just take the blue light with you." The next day, the soldier was taken to court, and although he had done nothing wrong, the judge sentenced him to death. As he was led out, he begged the king for a final mercy. "What kind of mercy?" asked the king. "That I may smoke one more pipe on the way," replied the soldier. "You may smoke three," said the king, "but don't think that I will spare your life." The soldier took out his pipe and lit it with the blue light, and as a few rings of smoke rose, the little man appeared, carrying a small club, and said, "What does my lord command?" "Strike down the false judges and their executioners, and spare neither the king, who has treated me so badly," said the soldier. The little man ran back and forth, zickzack, and with his club, anyone he touched fell to the ground and did not dare to move again. The king was afraid, and begged for mercy, promising to give the soldier the kingdom and the king's daughter in marriage if he would spare his life. The soldier, however, asked for nothing more than to be allowed to keep his soldier's rank and to marry in his new status. The king granted him this, and so the soldier became a rich man and lived happily with his wife.
