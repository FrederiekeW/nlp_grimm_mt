There were two brothers, one rich, the other poor. The rich one, however, gave the poor one nothing, and he had to scrape by from the grain trade; often it went so poorly for him that he had no bread for his wife and children. One day, he drove his cart through the forest, and saw on the side a large, bald mountain, which he had never seen before. He stopped and looked at it in wonder. As he stood there, he saw twelve wild, large men coming: because he believed they were robbers, he pushed his cart into the underbrush and climbed onto a tree to wait and see what would happen. The twelve men went in front of the mountain and shouted, "Berg Semsi, Berg Semsi, open up." Immediately, the bald mountain split in two, and the twelve went in, and as they were inside, it closed itself up again. After a short while, it opened up again, and the men came out, carrying heavy sacks on their backs, and when they were all back in the daylight, they shouted, "Berg Semsi, Berg Semsi, close up." Then the mountain closed itself up, and there was no entrance to be seen, and the twelve men went away. As soon as they were out of sight, the poor man climbed down from the tree and was curious about what might be hidden inside the mountain. So he went in front of it and said, "Berg Semsi, Berg Semsi, open up," and the mountain opened up for him. He went inside, and the whole mountain was a cave full of silver and gold, and in the back were great heaps of pearls and glittering precious stones, like grain piled up. The poor man did not know what to do, and whether he should take any of the treasures; finally, he filled his pockets with gold, but left the pearls and precious stones behind. When he came out, he said, "Berg Semsi, Berg Semsi, close up," and the mountain closed itself up, and he drove his cart home. Now he no longer had to worry and could buy bread and wine for his wife and children with his gold, and he lived happily and honestly, gave to the poor, and did good to everyone. But when the money ran out, he went to his brother and borrowed a measure, and went back to the mountain to get some more. However, he did not touch the great treasures. When he wanted to get some more for the third time, he borrowed another measure from his brother. The rich one, however, had been jealous of his wealth and the beautiful household he had established for a long time, and could not understand where the wealth came from and what his brother was doing with the measure. So he thought up a trick and covered the ground with pitch, and when he got the measure back, a gold coin had stuck to it. Immediately, he went to his brother and asked him, "What did you measure with the measure?" "Grain and barley," said the other. Then he showed him the gold coin and threatened him, if he did not tell the truth, he would take him to court. He told him everything that had happened. The rich one, however, immediately had a wagon harnessed up, drove out, and wanted to use the opportunity to bring back different treasures. When he came to the mountain, he shouted, "Berg Semsi, Berg Semsi, open up." The mountain opened up, and he went in. Inside, all the treasures lay before him, and he did not know where to start. Finally, he loaded precious stones onto as much as he could carry. He wanted to take his load out, but because his heart and mind were completely filled with the treasures, he had forgotten the name of the mountain and shouted, "Berg Simeli, Berg Simeli, open up." But that was not the right name, and the mountain did not stir and remained closed. Then he was afraid, but the longer he thought about it, the more his thoughts became confused, and the treasures did not help him any more. In the evening, the mountain opened up, and the twelve robbers came in, and when they saw him, they laughed and shouted, "Bird, we've finally got you, do you think we didn't notice that you came in twice, but we couldn't catch you, but you won't come out a third time." Then he cried, "It was not me, it was my brother," but he could not beg for his life and say what he wanted, they cut off his head. Then the poor man went back to the mountain, said, "Berg Semsi, Berg Semsi, open up," and went inside, and the mountain was still open. The poor man took what he wanted from the treasures and carried it out, and the mountain remained open until he had taken everything out. When he finally had taken everything out, the mountain closed itself up, and the poor man drove his cart home. Now he lived even happier and more honestly than before, and the rich one was dead, and the twelve robbers had been driven away.
