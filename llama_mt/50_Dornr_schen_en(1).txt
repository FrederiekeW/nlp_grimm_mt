In times past, a king and a queen lived who said every day, "Oh, if only we had a child!" and never got one. One day, while the queen was bathing, a frog crawled out of the water and spoke to her, saying, "Your wish will be fulfilled before a year passes, and you will give birth to a daughter." What the frog said came to pass, and the queen gave birth to a girl who was so beautiful that the king was overjoyed and held a grand feast. He invited not only his relatives, friends, and acquaintances but also the wise women, so that they would be fond and favorable to the child. There were thirteen of them in his kingdom, but since he only had twelve golden plates, one of them had to stay at home. The feast was celebrated with great pomp, and when it was over, the wise women bestowed their gifts on the child: one with virtue, another with beauty, the third with wealth, and so on with everything that is desirable in the world. Just as the eleventh of them had finished speaking, the thirteenth entered the room. She wanted to avenge herself because she had not been invited, and without greeting or looking at anyone, she cried out in a loud voice, "The princess should prick her finger with a spindle and fall dead!" Without saying another word, she turned and left the room. Everyone was shocked, and the twelfth woman stepped forward, who still had her wish to make and, because she could not undo the evil spell but only mitigate it, said, "It shall not be death, but a hundred-year sleep, in which the princess will fall."

The king, who wanted to protect his beloved child from misfortune, gave the order that all spindles in the entire kingdom should be burned. But the gifts of the wise women were all fulfilled in the child, for she was so beautiful, virtuous, friendly, and wise that everyone who saw her had to love her. On the day when she was fifteen years old, the king and queen were not at home, and the girl was alone in the castle. She went everywhere, looked at rooms and chambers, and came to an old tower. She climbed the narrow staircase and reached a small door. In the castle, a rusty key was stuck, and when she turned it, the door opened, and an old woman was sitting in a small room with a spindle and spinning flax. "Good day, old woman," said the princess, "what are you doing?" "I am spinning," said the old woman, nodding her head. "What is that thing that is jumping around so merrily?" said the girl, took the spindle, and wanted to spin. As soon as she touched the spindle, the magic spell was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger with it.

In that instant, she felt the pain and fell onto the bed that was there and fell into a deep sleep. And this sleep spread throughout the castle: the king and queen, who had just come home and entered the hall, began to fall asleep, and the entire court with them. The horses in the stable, the dogs in the yard, the pigeons on the roof, the flies on the wall, yes, even the fire on the hearth, which was flickering, fell asleep, and the roast stopped browning, and the cook, who was about to scold the kitchen boy for something, let him go and fell asleep. And the wind died down, and not a leaf stirred on the trees in front of the castle.

But a thorny hedge began to grow around the castle, which grew higher every year, and eventually surrounded the entire castle, and even beyond it, so that nothing more was visible, not even the flag on the roof. The story of the beautiful sleeping beauty, as the princess was called, spread throughout the land, so that from time to time, princes came and tried to penetrate the hedge. But it was not possible, for the thorns, as if they had hands, held together tightly, and the young men got stuck in them and died a pitiful death. After many years, a prince came again to the land, and heard an old man tell him about the thorny hedge, which was said to be behind it, and in which a wonderful princess, sleeping beauty, had been sleeping for a hundred years, along with the king and queen and the entire court. He also knew from his grandfather that many princes had come before and tried to penetrate the hedge, but they had gotten stuck and died a sad death. The young man said, "I am not afraid, I will go and see the beautiful sleeping beauty." The old man tried to dissuade him, but he would not listen to his words.

Just then, the hundred years had passed, and the day had come when sleeping beauty was to awaken. As the prince approached the thorny hedge, it was made up of large, beautiful flowers that opened and closed themselves, allowing him to pass through unharmed, and behind him, they closed again. In the castle courtyard, he saw the horses and spotted hunting dogs lying and sleeping, on the roof, the pigeons had their heads tucked under their wings. And when he entered the house, the flies on the wall, the cook in the kitchen, and the maid were all asleep. He went further and saw the entire court lying and sleeping in the hall, and above the throne, the king and queen were lying. He went further and everything was so still that one could hear one's own breath, and finally, he came to the tower and opened the door to the small room where sleeping beauty lay. There she was, and she was so beautiful that he could not look away, and he bent down and kissed her. As soon as he touched her with the kiss, sleeping beauty opened her eyes, awakened, and looked at him with a friendly gaze. They went together downstairs, and the king and queen awakened, and the entire court saw each other with wide eyes. And the horses in the courtyard stood up and shook themselves: the hunting dogs sprang up and wagged their tails: the pigeons on the roof pulled their heads out from under their wings, looked around, and flew into the field: the flies on the walls crawled on: the fire in the kitchen flared up and cooked the food: the roast started browning again: and the cook gave the young man a slap on the face, so that he cried out: and the maid finished plucking the chicken. And the wedding of the prince and sleeping beauty was celebrated with great pomp, and they lived happily until the end.
