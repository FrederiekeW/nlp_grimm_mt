There was a man whose wife had died, and a woman whose husband had died; and the man had a daughter, and the woman also had a daughter. The girls were acquainted with each other and went for a walk together and came to the woman's house. Then she spoke to the man's daughter, "Listen, tell your father that I want to marry him, then you will wash your face in milk every morning and drink wine, but my daughter will wash her face in water and drink water." The girl went home and told her father what the woman had said. The man said, "What should I do? Marriage is a joy and a burden." Finally, because he could not make up his mind, he took off his shoe and said, "Take this shoe, it has a hole in the sole, go with it to the floor, hang it on the big nail, and then pour water into it. If it holds the water, I will take another wife, but if it leaks, I will not." The girl did as he had told her, but the water closed the hole, and the shoe was full to the top. She told her father how it had turned out. Then he went up and saw that it was true, and he went to the widow and married her, and the wedding was held.

The next morning, when the two girls got up, there was milk for the man's daughter to wash her face and wine to drink, but water for the woman's daughter to wash her face and water to drink. The second morning, there was water for the man's daughter to wash her face and water to drink, just as there was for the woman's daughter. And the third morning, there was water for the man's daughter to wash her face and water to drink, but milk for the woman's daughter to wash her face and wine to drink, and it stayed that way. The woman was jealous of her stepdaughter and didn't know how to make her life worse from one day to the next. She was also envious because her stepdaughter was beautiful and lovely, while her own daughter was ugly and disagreeable.

Once in the winter, when it had frozen hard and the mountains and valleys were covered in snow, the woman made a dress out of paper, called the girl and said, "Put on this dress and go into the forest and bring me a basket full of strawberries; I have a craving for them." "Dear God," said the girl, "in the winter strawberries don't grow, the earth is frozen, and the snow covers everything. And why should I wear this paper dress? It's so cold outside that one's breath freezes; the wind blows through it and the thorns tear it off me." "Do you want to contradict me?" said the stepmother, "get out of here and don't come back until you bring me a basket full of strawberries." Then she gave her a piece of hard bread and said, "You can eat that all day," and thought, "out there, she'll freeze to death and starve, and I'll never see her again."

The girl was obedient, put on the paper dress and went out with the basket. There was nothing but snow as far as the eye could see, and no green sprout in sight. When she came to the forest, she saw a small cottage, and three little men were looking out of the window. She wished them a good day and knocked gently on the door. They called out to her, and she went in and sat down on a bench by the fire, where she wanted to warm up and have her breakfast. The little men said, "Give us some of that too." "Of course," she said, and divided her bread in half and gave them half. They asked her, "What are you doing here in the forest in the middle of winter in your thin dress?" "Oh," she replied, "I'm supposed to find a basket full of strawberries, and I'm not allowed to come back home until I do." When she had finished her bread, they gave her a broom and said, "Sweep the snow away from behind the back door." But when she went outside, the three little men said to each other, "What shall we give her, because she is so kind and good, and she shared her bread with us?" The first said, "I'll give her that she will get more beautiful every day." The second said, "I'll give her that gold coins will fall out of her mouth every time she speaks." The third said, "I'll give her that a king will come and take her as his wife."

The girl did as the little men had told her, swept the snow away from behind the cottage, and what do you think she found? A basket full of ripe strawberries, which were dark red and sticking out of the snow. She filled her basket with joy, thanked the little men, shook their hands, and ran back home to bring the strawberries to her stepmother. As soon as she entered and said "good evening," a gold coin fell out of her mouth. Then she told her stepmother what had happened to her in the forest, but every time she spoke, more gold coins fell out of her mouth, so that soon the whole room was covered in them. "Now look at her pride," said the stepsister, "throwing away all that money," but secretly she was envious and wanted to go into the forest and find strawberries too. The mother said, "No, my dear daughter, it's too cold, you might freeze to death." But because she wouldn't leave her alone, she finally gave in and made the girl a beautiful fur coat, which she had to wear, and gave her bread and cake to take with her.

The girl went into the forest, and just as she approached the small cottage, the three little men looked out again, but she didn't greet them and, without looking around or greeting them, stumbled into the cottage, sat down by the fire, and started eating her bread and cake. "Give us some of that too," cried the little men, but she replied, "It was given to me, not to you, so how can I give you some?" When she had finished eating, they said, "There, you have a broom, sweep the snow away from in front of the back door." "Oh, sweep it yourself," she said, "I'm not your servant." When she saw that they didn't want to give her anything, she went outside. The three little men said to each other, "What shall we give her, because she is so unkind and has a jealous heart that doesn't want to give anyone anything?" The first said, "I'll give her that she will get uglier every day." The second said, "I'll give her that a toad will come out of her mouth every time she speaks." The third said, "I'll give her that she will die a miserable death."

The girl searched for strawberries in the snow, but when she didn't find any, she went back home in a bad mood. And when she opened her mouth to tell her mother what had happened to her in the forest, a toad came out of her mouth every time she spoke, so that everyone was disgusted by her.

The stepmother was even more angry and thought only of how she could make the man's daughter's life miserable, whose beauty was growing every day. Finally, she took a kettle, put it on the fire, and boiled some yarn in it. When it was done, she hung it on the girl's shoulder and gave her an axe, saying, "You should go to the frozen river, make a hole in the ice, and let the yarn slide down." The girl was obedient, went and made a hole in the ice, and when she was in the middle of it, a magnificent carriage came driving by, with the king inside. The carriage stopped, and the king asked, "My child, who are you and what are you doing here?" "I am a poor girl and sliding yarn," she replied. The king felt pity for her and, when he saw how beautiful she was, said, "Do you want to ride with me?" "Oh, yes, with all my heart," she replied, because she was glad to get away from her mother and stepsister.

So she got into the carriage and rode with the king, and when they arrived at his castle, the wedding was celebrated with great pomp, as the little men had promised the girl. Over a year later, the young queen gave birth to a son, and when the stepmother heard about the great happiness, she came to the castle with her daughter, pretending to visit. But when the king was out and no one was around, the wicked woman grabbed the queen by the head, and her daughter grabbed her by the feet, lifted her out of bed, and threw her out the window into the river. Then they got into bed, and the old woman covered her ugly daughter up to her head. When the king came back and wanted to talk to his wife, the old woman said, "Quiet, quiet, she's in a fever, you should let her rest today." The king thought nothing of it and came back the next morning, and when he talked to his wife, a toad came out of her mouth every time she spoke, while before it was a gold coin. He asked what that was, but the old woman said it was from the fever, and it would go away on its own.

But at night, the kitchen boy saw a duck swimming through the gutter, which said, "King, what are you doing? Are you sleeping or awake?" And when he didn't answer, it said, "What are my guests doing?" The kitchen boy replied, "They're sleeping soundly." It asked further, "What's my little child doing?" The kitchen boy replied, "It's sleeping peacefully in its cradle." Then it went up to the queen's room in the form of a duck, gave her something to drink, shook her bed, and covered her up, and then swam away through the gutter again. It came two nights, and on the third night, it said to the kitchen boy, "Go and tell the king to take his sword and swing it three times over me." The kitchen boy ran and told the king, who came with his sword and swung it three times over the ghost. And on the third time, his wife stood before him, fresh, alive, and healthy, just as she had been before.

The king was overjoyed, but he kept the queen hidden in a room until Sunday, when the child was to be baptized. And when it was baptized, he said, "What should be done to someone who takes another person out of bed and throws them into the water?" "Nothing better," replied the old woman, "than to put the wicked person into a barrel that has been studded with nails, and roll it down the mountain into the water." The king said, "You have given your judgment," and had a barrel brought, studded with nails, and put the old woman and her daughter inside. Then the barrel was sealed and rolled down the mountain, until it rolled into the river. The old woman and her daughter were inside and cried, "Mercy, mercy!" But the king laughed and said, "We've been annoyed by you for long enough." The old woman and her daughter were drowned in the barrel.
