A peasant had a son who was as small as a thumb and grew no larger. One day the peasant wanted to go into the field to plow and said to his son, "You want to come with me?" "Yes, I want to come with you," replied the son. "No, you stay here," said the peasant, "you won't be of any use to me there; you might even get lost." The son began to cry, and to calm him down, the peasant put him in his pocket and took him along. When they were in the field, he took him out of his pocket and put him in a fresh furrow. As the peasant was working, a giant came over the hill. "Look, there's a big giant," said the peasant to his son, trying to scare him into behaving. "He's coming to get you," he said. But the giant picked up the son with two fingers, examined him, and then walked off with him without saying a word. The peasant was so frightened that he couldn't make a sound and thought he would never see his son again.

The giant took the son to his home and let him suckle from his breast, and the son grew and became strong and big, just like the giant. After two years, the giant took the son to the forest and said, "Try to pull a plow." The son was already so strong that he could pull a young tree out of the ground with its roots. The giant said, "That's not good enough," and took him back to suckle him some more. After another two years, the giant took the son to the forest and said, "Try to pull a plow." The son was now so strong that he could pull an old tree out of the ground. The giant was still not satisfied and took the son to suckle him again. After two more years, the giant took the son to the forest and said, "Now, pull a plow." The son was so strong that he could pull a thick oak tree out of the ground with a loud crash. The giant said, "That's enough," and took the son back to the field where he had taken him from. The peasant was still working behind the plow, and the giant's son came up to him and said, "Do you see, Father, what my son has become?" The peasant was frightened and said, "No, you're not my son; I don't want you. Go away from me." "Of course I'm your son," replied the giant's son. "Let me help you with the work; I can plow just as well as you and even better." "No, no, you're not my son," said the peasant. "You can't even plow; go away from me." The peasant was afraid of the giant's son, so he let go of the plow and stepped back, sitting down on the ground. The giant's son took the plow and pulled it with one hand, but the force was so great that the plow sank deep into the ground. The peasant couldn't bear to watch and called out, "If you want to plow, you don't have to pull so hard; that will make poor work." The giant's son said, "Go home, Father, and have Mother cook a big pot of food; I'll finish the field while you're away."

The peasant went home and told his wife to cook a big pot of food, while the giant's son continued to plow the field, which was two acres large, all by himself. When he finished, he hitched himself to the harrow and harrowed the entire field with two harrows at the same time. When he was finished, he went into the forest and pulled two oak trees out of the ground, placed them on his shoulders, and attached an ox to each end, and then carried everything, as if it were a bundle of straw, back to his parents' house. When he arrived in the yard, his mother didn't recognize him and asked, "Who is that enormous man?" The peasant replied, "That's our son." His wife said, "No, our son is not that at all; he was a tiny thing." She called out to the giant's son, "Go away; we don't want you." The giant's son remained silent, unhitched his oxen, and fed them hay and oats, just as one should. When he was finished, he went into the house, sat down on a bench, and said, "Mother, I'm hungry; is dinner ready?" His mother replied, "Yes," and brought in two large pots of food, which would have been enough for them to eat for eight days. The giant's son ate both pots by himself and asked if there was more to eat. "No," said his mother, "that's all we have." "That was just a snack," he said. "I need more." His mother was afraid to resist him and went to cook a big pot of meat over the fire. When it was done, she brought it in, and the giant's son said, "Finally, there are some bigger pieces." He ate everything, but it wasn't enough to satisfy his hunger. He said to his father, "I see that I won't get enough to eat here; can you get me an iron rod, one that's strong and that I won't break in two when I put it in front of my knees?" The peasant was happy to oblige and hitched up his two oxen to a wagon and went to the blacksmith to get a rod as big and thick as the two oxen could pull. The giant's son took the rod and, snap! broke it in two in the middle and threw it away. The peasant hitched up four oxen and went to the blacksmith to get a rod as big and thick as the four oxen could pull. The giant's son broke this one too, and said, "Father, this one won't help me either; you'll have to get a stronger rod and hitch up more oxen." The peasant hitched up eight oxen and went to the blacksmith to get a rod as big and thick as the eight oxen could pull. When the giant's son took the rod, he broke it in two above the middle and said, "Father, I see that you can't get a rod strong enough for me; I won't stay here any longer."

The giant's son left and presented himself as a blacksmith's apprentice. He came to a village where a blacksmith lived, who was a miser and wanted to keep everything for himself. The giant's son went to the blacksmith's shop and asked if he needed an apprentice. "Yes," said the blacksmith, looking at him and thinking, "This is a capable young man; he'll be good for business and earn his bread." He asked, "What do you want for pay?" "I want no pay," replied the giant's son, "but every fourteen days, when the other apprentices get their pay, I want you to give me two blows with a hammer; you'll have to put up with that." The miser was overjoyed and thought he would save a lot of money. On the next morning, the apprentice was supposed to suggest a plan, but the master brought a glowing iron rod and the apprentice struck the first blow, and the iron flew off, and the anvil sank into the ground so deep that they couldn't pull it out. The miser was angry and said, "What's this? You can't work with me; you hit too hard; what do you want for the one blow?" The apprentice replied, "I just want one small blow; nothing more." And he kicked the master with his foot, and the master flew over four stacks of hay. The apprentice then took the thickest iron rod in the shop and left.

After traveling for a while, he came to a manor and asked the steward if he needed a large servant. "Yes," said the steward, "I could use one; you look like a capable young man; you seem to be able to do something. What do you want for pay?" The apprentice replied, "I want no pay, but every year, I want you to give me three blows with a hammer; you'll have to put up with that." The steward was happy with this and thought he would save a lot of money. On the next morning, the servant was supposed to go into the forest with the other servants, but he was still in bed. One of the servants called out, "Get up; it's time to go; you have to come with us." "Ah," said the servant gruffly and stubbornly, "you go ahead; I'll be there before you all." The other servants went to the steward and told him that the large servant was still in bed and didn't want to go into the forest. The steward said they should wake him up again and tell him to hitch up the oxen. The servant replied, "You go ahead; I'll be there before you all." He stayed in bed for two more hours, then got up, ate two bushels of beans, and cooked himself a meal. When he had finished eating, he hitched up the oxen and drove them into the forest. Not far from the forest was a hollow road where he had to drive, so he drove the wagon forward, then stopped the oxen, and went behind the wagon, took some trees and branches, and made a big barricade, so that no oxen could pass through. When he arrived at the forest, the other servants were driving their loaded wagons out and wanted to go home, and he said, "You go ahead; I'll be there before you all." He didn't drive very far into the forest, but pulled two of the largest trees out of the ground, put them on the wagon, and turned around. When he came to the barricade, the other servants were still stuck and couldn't get through. "Do you see that?" he said. "If you had stayed with me, you would have been home just as quickly and could have slept for another hour." He wanted to drive through, but his oxen couldn't get through the barricade, so he unhitched them, put them on top of the wagon, took the reins in his hand, and pulled everything through, as if it were a load of feathers. When he got through, he said to the other servants, "Do you see that? I'm faster than you." He drove further, and the other servants had to stop. When he arrived at the manor, he took a tree and showed it to the steward and said, "Isn't that a fine log?" The steward said to his wife, "The servant is good; even if he sleeps a lot, he's faster than the others."

The servant worked for the steward for a year, and when the other servants got their pay, he said it was time for him to get his pay too. The steward was afraid of the blows he would get and begged him to forgive him and take the blows. He said, "I'd rather be a steward and you be a servant." "No," said the servant, "I'm a servant and I want to stay that way; but I want to get what I agreed on." The steward wanted to give him everything he asked for, but the servant said, "No." The steward didn't know what to do and asked for a fourteen-day delay to think about it. The servant agreed, and the steward called all his clerks together and asked them to come up with a plan to get rid of the servant. The clerks thought for a long time and finally said, "No one in his life is safe who treats people like a fly and kills them with a single blow." They suggested that the steward tell the servant to go down into the well and clean it out. When he was down there, they would roll a millstone down on him, and it would crush his head. The steward liked this idea, and the servant agreed to go down into the well. When he was at the bottom, they rolled the millstone down, but the servant cried out, "Get the chickens out of the well; they're scratching in the sand up there and throwing grain into my eyes, so I can't see." The steward shouted, "Shoo! Shoo!" as if he were chasing away the chickens. When the servant had finished his work, he climbed out of the well and said, "Look, I've got a nice necklace on." The millstone was around his neck. The servant wanted to take his pay now, but the steward asked for another fourteen-day delay. The clerks came together again and suggested that the steward tell the servant to go to the cursed mill and work there at night, grinding grain. No one had ever come out of the mill alive in the morning. The steward liked this idea and told the servant to go to the mill and grind eight wagonloads of grain. The servant took two wagonloads in each pocket, four on his back, and four on his chest, and went to the mill. The miller said, "You can work here during the day, but not at night; the mill is cursed, and anyone who goes in there at night will be found dead in the morning." The servant replied, "I'll manage; just get out of here and take a nap." He went into the mill, threw the grain on the floor, and sat down on a bench. After a while, a big table came in, and on it, there was a lot of food, all of it laid out by itself, since no one was there to serve it. Then the chairs were pushed back, but no people came, until he saw fingers, which were handling the knives and forks and placing food on the plates, but he couldn't see anything else. He was hungry, and the food looked good, so he sat down at the table and ate with the others, enjoying himself. When they had finished eating and the others had also eaten all their food, the lights went out, and it was pitch black. He felt a slap in the face, and said, "If that happens again, I'll strike back too." When he felt another slap, he struck back too. And so it went all night, with him taking nothing for granted and giving as good as he got. At dawn, everything stopped. When the miller got up, he wanted to see the servant and was amazed that he was still alive. The servant said, "I ate my fill, I got slapped, but I also slapped back." The miller was happy and said, "The mill is free; I'll give you a lot of money as a reward." The servant replied, "I don't want any money; I have enough." Then he took the flour on his back and went home, saying to the steward, "I've finished the job, and now I want my pay." The steward was even more afraid and paced back and forth in his room, sweating. He opened a window to get some fresh air, but before he knew it, the servant had given him a kick that sent him flying out the window, higher and higher, until he disappeared from sight. The servant then turned to the steward's wife and said, "He won't be back; you'll have to take the next blow." She cried out, "No, no, I can't take it!" and opened another window, and the servant kicked her too, sending her flying out the window, higher than her husband. They both floated in the air, unable to reach each other, and I don't know if they're still floating there; the giant's son took his iron rod and continued on his way.
