Once upon a time there was a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as he came into the forest, he heard a crying as if a small child were crying. He went after the crying and came to a high tree, and on top of it sat a small child. But it was the mother who had fallen asleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen the child in her lap: then it flew over and took it with its beak and set it on the high tree.

The forester climbed up, fetched the child down and thought ‘you want to take the child home with you and raise it together with your Lenchen.’ He brought it home, and the two children grew up together. But the one that was found on the tree and was taken away by a bird was called Foundling Bird. Foundling Bird and Lenchen had such a great love for each other, no, such a great love that if one of them did not see the other, it was sad.

The forester had an old cook who one evening took two buckets and began to carry water, and went out to the well several times. Lenchen saw it and said ‘listen, old Sanne, what are you carrying so much water for?’ ‘If you don’t want to tell anyone, I’ll tell you.’ Then Lenchen said no, she wouldn’t tell anyone, so the cook said ‘tomorrow morning, when the forester is out hunting, I will cook the water, and when it’s boiling in the kettle, I will throw the Foundling Bird in and cook it.’

The next morning, early, the forester climbed up and went hunting, and when he was gone, the children were still in bed. Then Lenchen spoke to the Foundling Bird ‘if you leave me, I won’t leave you either:’ so the Foundling Bird said ‘never and never.’ Then Lenchen said ‘I’ll just tell you, old Sanne carried so much water into the house last evening, I asked her why she was doing it, she said if I didn’t want to tell anyone, she would tell me: I said I wouldn’t tell anyone: then she said tomorrow morning, when the father is out hunting, she would boil the kettle full of water, throw you in and cook you. We will quickly get up, get dressed and go together.’

So the two children got up, quickly got dressed and went. As the water was boiling in the kettle, the cook went into the bedroom, wanted to fetch the Foundling Bird and throw it in, but when she came in and approached the beds, the children were both gone: then she became terribly frightened and said to herself ‘what shall I say when the forester comes home and sees that the children are gone? I must quickly run after them, that we can catch them.’

So the cook sent three servants after, who should run and catch the children. The children, however, sat outside the forest, and when they saw the three servants coming from afar, Lenchen spoke to the Foundling Bird ‘if you leave me, I won’t leave you either.’ So the Foundling Bird said ‘never and never.’ Then Lenchen said ‘you shall become a rosebush, and I a rose on it.’ As the three servants came to the forest, there was nothing but a rosebush and a rose on it, the children nowhere. Then they said ‘there’s nothing to be done here,’ and went home and told the cook they had seen nothing in the world but a rosebush and a rose on it. Then the old cook scolded ‘you simpletons, you should have cut the rosebush in two and broken off the rose and brought it back home quickly.’ They had to go out again and search. The children saw them coming from afar, and Lenchen spoke to the Foundling Bird ‘if you leave me, I won’t leave you either.’ The Foundling Bird said ‘never and never.’ Then Lenchen said ‘so you shall become a church and I the crown in it.’ As the three servants came to it, there was nothing but a church and a crown in it. They said to each other ‘what shall we do here, let’s go home.’ When they came home, the cook asked if they had found anything: they said no, they had found nothing but a church, where there was a crown in it. ‘You fools,’ scolded the cook, ‘why didn’t you break the church and bring the crown back home?’ The old cook then got up and went with the three servants after the children. The children saw the three servants coming from afar, and the cook waddling behind. Then Lenchen spoke to the Foundling Bird ‘if you leave me, I won’t leave you either.’ The Foundling Bird said ‘never and never.’ Then Lenchen said ‘you shall become a pond, and I a duck on it.’ The cook, however, came up and when she saw the pond, she lay down on it and wanted to drain it. But the duck swam quickly, grasped her with its beak at the head and pulled her into the water: then the old witch had to drown. Then the children went home together and were very happy; and if they hadn’t died, they would still be living.
