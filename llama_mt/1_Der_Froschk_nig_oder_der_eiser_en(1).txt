In the old days, when wishes still helped, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that even the sun, which has seen so many things, was astonished whenever it shone on her face. Near the castle of the king was a large dark forest, and in the forest, under an old linden tree, was a well: if the day was hot, the king's child would go out into the forest and sit at the edge of the cool well: and if she was bored, she would take a golden ball, throw it up in the air, and catch it again; and that was her favorite toy.

Now it happened one day that the golden ball of the king's child did not fall into her hand, which she had held up in the air, but instead hit the ground and rolled straight into the water. The king's child followed it with her eyes, but the ball disappeared, and the well was so deep that you couldn't see the bottom. She began to cry and cried louder and couldn't comfort herself. And as she was lamenting, someone called out to her, 'What are you doing, king's child, you're crying so loudly that even a stone would feel sorry for you.' She looked around to see where the voice was coming from, and she saw a frog, who had stretched his thick, ugly head out of the water. 'Oh, you're the old water frog,' she said, 'I'm crying because my golden ball has fallen into the well.' 'Be quiet and don't cry,' replied the frog, 'I can certainly help you, but what will you give me if I bring your toy back up?' 'Whatever you want, dear frog,' she said,'my clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even my golden crown, which I wear.' The frog replied, 'I don't want your clothes, your pearls and jewels, or your golden crown; but if you want to be friends with me and have me as your companion and playmate, to sit next to you at your table, to eat from your golden plate, to drink from your cup, and to sleep in your bed, then I'll go down and bring your golden ball back up for you.' 'Oh yes,' she said, 'I promise you everything you want, if you just bring me the ball back.' But she thought to herself, 'What a foolish frog is talking, who sits in the water with his own kind and croaks, and can never be a human's companion.'

The frog, after he had received her promise, ducked his head under, sank down, and after a while came back up, had the ball in his mouth, and threw it onto the grass. The king's child was overjoyed when she saw her beautiful toy again, picked it up, and ran off with it. 'Wait, wait,' cried the frog, 'pick me up, I can't run as fast as you.' But what good was it to him that he cried 'quack, quack' as loudly as he could? She didn't listen to him, ran home, and soon forgot about the poor frog, who had to go back down into the well.

The next day, when she sat at the table with the king and all the courtiers, eating from her golden plate, something came crawling up the marble stairs, 'plish, platsch, plish, platsch,' and when it reached the top, it knocked on the door and called out, 'King's child, youngest, open up!' She got up and wanted to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there was the frog sitting there. She quickly slammed the door shut, sat back down at the table, and was very scared. The king noticed that her heart was beating violently and asked, 'My child, what are you afraid of? Is a giant standing outside and wanting to take you?' 'No,' she replied, 'it's not a giant, but a very ugly frog.' 'What does the frog want from you?' 'Oh dear father, when I was sitting by the well in the forest yesterday and playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so much, the frog brought it back up for me, and because he demanded it, I promised him that he would be my companion and playmate, that I would sit next to him at my table, eat from his plate, drink from his cup, and sleep in his bed. I thought, however, that he would never come out of the water.' It knocked on the door again, and called out,

'King's child, youngest,
open up,
do you not know what you said
yesterday
by the cool well-water?
King's child, youngest,
open up.'

The king said, 'What you promised, you must also keep; go and open the door.' She went and opened it, and the frog hopped in, following her every step until he reached her chair. Then he sat down and called out, 'Pick me up and bring me to your chair.' She hesitated until the king finally ordered her to. When the frog was sitting on her chair, he wanted to get onto the table, and when he was sitting there, he said, 'Now move my golden plate closer, so that we can eat together.' She did so, but you could see that she didn't do it gladly. The frog ate his fill, but she had trouble swallowing each bite. Finally, he said, 'I'm full and tired, now take me to your bedroom and make your bed ready, so that we can sleep together.' The king's child began to cry and was afraid of the cold frog, which she didn't dare touch, and which was now supposed to sleep in her beautiful, clean bed. The king, however, became angry and said, 'Who helped you when you were in distress, you must not despise him afterwards.' She grabbed him with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and set him in a corner. But when she lay in bed, he crawled over and said, 'I'm tired, I want to sleep just like you: pick me up, or I'll tell your father.' She became bitter and angry, picked him up, and threw him with all her might against the wall, 'Now you'll have peace, you ugly frog.'

But when he fell, he was no longer a frog, but a king's son with beautiful and friendly eyes. He was now, according to the king's will, her dear companion and husband. He told her that he had been cursed by a wicked witch and that no one could have rescued him from the well except her alone. Tomorrow, they would go together to his kingdom. Then they fell asleep, and the next morning, when the sun woke them up, a carriage came driving up, drawn by eight white horses with white ostrich feathers on their heads, and golden chains on their legs, and behind it stood the young king's loyal servant, faithful Heinrich. Faithful Heinrich had been so sad when his master was transformed into a frog that he had had three iron bands put around his heart to keep it from breaking from grief and sorrow. The carriage was meant to take the young king back to his kingdom; faithful Heinrich lifted both of them up and put himself back behind, and was full of joy at the rescue. And as they rode a little way, he heard a loud cracking sound, as if something had broken. The young king turned around and cried, 'Heinrich, the carriage is breaking!' 'No, sir, the carriage is not breaking,' replied Heinrich, 'it's one of the bands from my heart, which was in great pain when you were sitting in the well, as a frog.' It cracked again and again, and the young king thought each time that the carriage was breaking, but it was only the bands breaking off from faithful Heinrich's heart because his master was rescued and happy. They rode on, and when they arrived in the kingdom, everything was in flowers and blossoms, and the people cheered and shouted, 'Hurray, hurray, our king is back!' And the king and his bride, the king's child, rode on a horse, and faithful Heinrich rode behind them, and cheered and shouted, 'Hurray, hurray, our king is back, the king is back, and my joy is great!'
