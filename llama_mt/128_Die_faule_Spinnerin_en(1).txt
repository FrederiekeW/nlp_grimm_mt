In a village lived a man and a woman, and the woman was so lazy that she never wanted to work: and what her husband gave her to spin, she didn’t spin it to the end, and what she spun, she didn’t wind, but left it all wrapped up on the spindle. When the man scolded her, she was quick to speak and said, ‘How can I wind it, since I don’t have a spindle? Go first into the forest and bring me one.’ ‘If that’s the problem,’ said the man, ‘then I will go into the forest and bring back spindle wood.’ Then the woman was afraid that if he got the wood, he would make a spindle out of it, and she would have to wind it and spin it again fresh. She thought for a bit, and then a clever idea came to her, and she went secretly after the man into the forest. As he climbed up a tree to cut and chop the wood, she crept into the underbrush beneath where he couldn’t see her and cried out

‘Whoever hews spindle wood, dies,
Whoever winds it, is ruined.’

The man listened, laid his axe down for a while, and thought about what it might mean. ‘Well, what’s the matter!’ he said finally. ‘It must have been just a fancy in your head, don’t be afraid unnecessarily.’ So he picked up his axe again and wanted to chop. But again, from below, it cried out

‘Whoever hews spindle wood, dies,
Whoever winds it, is ruined.’

He stopped, got frightened, and pondered the thing. But after a bit, his heart came back to him, and he reached for his axe for the third time and wanted to chop. But for the third time, it cried out loudly

‘Whoever hews spindle wood, dies,
Whoever winds it, is ruined.’

Then he had had enough, and all desire was gone from him, so that he quickly climbed down from the tree and made his way home. The woman ran, as fast as she could, on side paths, so that she would get home sooner. When he came into the room, she acted innocently, as if nothing had happened, and said, ‘Well, do you bring a good spindle wood?’ ‘No,’ he said, ‘I see well, it’s not going with spinning.’ He told her what had happened to him in the forest, and from then on, he left her in peace.

But soon after, the man started again to get annoyed about the disorder in the house. ‘Woman,’ he said, ‘it’s a shame that the spun yarn is left lying on the spindle.’ ‘You know what,’ she said, ‘since we don’t have a spindle, let you stand on the floor and I’ll stand below, and I’ll throw the spindle up to you, and you’ll throw it back down, and we’ll have a thread.’ ‘Yes, that will do,’ said the man. So they did that, and when they were finished, he said, ‘The yarn is now strung, now it must be cooked.’ The woman got scared again, and said, ‘Yes, we’ll cook it tomorrow morning.’ But she thought to herself about a new trick. Early in the morning, she got up, made a fire, and put the kettle on, but instead of the yarn, she put a lump of flax in it, and let it cook. Then she went to the man, who was still in bed, and said to him, ‘I have to go out, you stay and watch the yarn in the kettle over the fire: but you must be on the lookout, because when the rooster crows, and you don’t look, the yarn will turn into flax.’ The man was ready and wanted to miss nothing, quickly got up and went into the kitchen. When he came to the kettle and looked inside, he saw with horror nothing but a lump of flax. Then the poor man was silent, thought he had done it wrong and was to blame, and from then on, he never spoke of yarn and spinning again. But you have to say it yourself, it was a wicked woman. It’s unbelievable how she treated her husband.
