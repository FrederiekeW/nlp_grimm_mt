Once upon a time, in the middle of winter, when the snowflakes were falling from the sky like feathers, a queen sat at a window with a frame of black ebony, and was sewing. And as she sewed and looked up at the snow, she pricked her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell into the snow. And because the red looked so beautiful against the white snow, she thought to herself, "I wish I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the ebony of the frame." Soon after, she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black-haired as ebony, and so she was called Snow White. And as soon as the child was born, the queen died.

After a year, the king took another wife. She was a beautiful woman, but she was proud and overbearing, and could not bear the thought that anyone might surpass her in beauty. She had a wonderful mirror, and when she stood before it and looked at her reflection, she would say:

"Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who is the fairest one of all?"

The mirror would answer:

"You, O Queen, are the fairest of all."

The queen was satisfied, for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth.

Snow White, on the other hand, grew up and became more beautiful with each passing day. When she was seven years old, she was as beautiful as the day, and more beautiful than the queen herself. One day, the queen asked the mirror:

"Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who is the fairest one of all?"

The mirror replied:

"You, O Queen, are the fairest here,
but Snow White is a thousand times more beautiful than you."

The queen was shocked and turned yellow and green with envy. From that day on, whenever she saw Snow White, her heart turned to stone, and she hated the child. And her envy and pride grew like a weed in her heart, so that she had no rest day or night. She called for a huntsman and said, "Take the child out into the forest, and kill it. Bring me its lungs and liver as a trophy." The huntsman obeyed, and took the child out into the forest. As he was about to kill it, the child began to weep and said, "Oh, dear huntsman, spare my life. I will run away into the forest and never come back." The huntsman had pity on the child, and said, "Then run away, you poor child." He thought to himself, "The wild beasts will soon eat you up," but he did not kill the child. Just then, a young fawn sprang by, and the huntsman killed it, took out its lungs and liver, and brought them to the queen as a trophy.

The child, on the other hand, ran away into the forest, all alone and frightened. It looked around at the trees, but did not know what to do. It ran until its feet could carry it no longer, and then it came to a small cottage. It went inside to rest, and found everything to be small, but neat and clean. There was a white table with seven little plates, each with its own spoon, seven knives, and seven forks, and seven cups. On the wall were seven little beds, each with a white sheet over it. The child was hungry and thirsty, and ate a little from each plate, and drank a little from each cup. It did not want to take everything from one plate or cup. After eating, it lay down in one of the beds, but none of them fit, until it came to the seventh, which was just right. It lay down in it, and fell asleep.

When it was dark, the seven dwarfs, who were miners in the mountains, came home. They lit their seven candles, and when the light was bright, they saw that someone had been in the house, for things were not in order as they had left them. The first dwarf said, "Who has sat in my chair?" The second said, "Who has eaten from my plate?" The third said, "Who has taken my bread?" The fourth said, "Who has eaten my vegetables?" The fifth said, "Who has used my knife?" The sixth said, "Who has cut my meat?" The seventh said, "Who has drunk from my cup?" They looked around, and saw that someone had been in each of their beds, and had slept in each of them. The seventh dwarf, however, looked into his bed, and saw Snow White lying in it, fast asleep. They all rushed in, and exclaimed, "Oh, what a wonder! Oh, what a wonder!" They were so amazed that they did not wake Snow White, but let her sleep in the bed. The seventh dwarf slept for an hour, and then woke up, and looked at Snow White, and exclaimed, "This child is so beautiful!" The other dwarfs came running, and they all exclaimed, "This child is so beautiful!"

Snow White woke up, and saw the dwarfs, and was frightened. They, however, were friendly, and asked her, "What is your name?" "My name is Snow White," she replied. "How did you come to our house?" they asked. She told them that her stepmother had wanted to kill her, but the huntsman had spared her life, and that she had run away all day, until she came to their house. The dwarfs said, "If you will take care of our house, cook, make the beds, wash, sew, and spin, and keep everything in order, you can stay with us, and we will give you everything you need." "Yes," said Snow White, "I will do it with all my heart," and she stayed with them.

The queen, however, believed that she had eaten Snow White's lungs and liver, and thought that she was the fairest of all. She looked at herself in the mirror, and said:

"Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who is the fairest one of all?"

The mirror replied:

"You, O Queen, are the fairest here,
but Snow White, over the mountains,
with the seven dwarfs,
is a thousand times more beautiful than you."

The queen was shocked, and knew that the mirror spoke the truth. She was angry, and thought of a new plan to kill Snow White. She disguised herself as an old peddler woman, and went over the mountains to the dwarfs' house. She knocked on the door, and called out, "Good day, my dear child, what do you have to sell?" Snow White looked out the window, and said, "Good day, dear old woman, what do you have to sell?" The peddler woman said, "I have beautiful ribbons of all colors." She pulled out a ribbon, and Snow White said, "I'll take it." The peddler woman said, "Come, child, let me tie the ribbon around your neck." Snow White had no suspicion, and let the peddler woman tie the ribbon around her neck. But the peddler woman tied it so tight that Snow White could not breathe, and she fell to the ground. "Now you are the fairest of all," said the peddler woman, and she ran away.

The dwarfs came home, and found Snow White lying on the ground, and they thought she was dead. They cut the ribbon, and Snow White began to breathe again. They warned her to be careful, and not to let anyone in when they were not there.

The queen, however, was not satisfied, and thought of another plan to kill Snow White. She disguised herself as an old woman, and went over the mountains to the dwarfs' house. She knocked on the door, and called out, "Good day, my dear child, what do you have to sell?" Snow White looked out the window, and said, "I'm not allowed to let anyone in." The old woman said, "I have a comb, and I'll give you a combing." Snow White had no suspicion, and let the old woman comb her hair. But the comb was poisoned, and Snow White fell to the ground. "You are the fairest of all," said the old woman, and she ran away.

The dwarfs came home, and found Snow White lying on the ground, and they thought she was dead. They searched for the poison, and found the comb, and when they removed it, Snow White came to life again. They warned her to be careful, and not to let anyone in when they were not there.

The queen, however, was not satisfied, and thought of another plan to kill Snow White. She disguised herself as an old woman, and went over the mountains to the dwarfs' house. She knocked on the door, and called out, "Good day, my dear child, what do you have to sell?" Snow White looked out the window, and said, "I'm not allowed to let anyone in." The old woman said, "I have an apple, and I'll give you a bite." Snow White had no suspicion, and took a bite of the apple. But the apple was poisoned, and Snow White fell to the ground. "You are the fairest of all," said the old woman, and she ran away.

The dwarfs came home, and found Snow White lying on the ground, and they thought she was dead. They searched for the poison, and found the apple core, and when they removed it, Snow White came to life again. They warned her to be careful, and not to let anyone in when they were not there.

The dwarfs, however, decided to bury Snow White in a glass coffin, so that they could see her from all sides. They wrote her name on the coffin, and that she was a princess, and they placed it on a mountain, and one of the dwarfs stayed with it, and watched over it. The animals came to visit Snow White, and wept over her, a raven, a dove, and a sparrow.

Snow White lay in the coffin for a long time, but did not decay, and looked as if she were sleeping. One day, a prince came to the forest, and came to the dwarfs' house, and saw the coffin, and read the inscription on it. He said to the dwarfs, "Let me have the coffin, and I will give you whatever you want." But the dwarfs refused, and said, "We will not give it up for all the gold in the world." The prince said, "Then give it to me, for I cannot live without seeing Snow White, and I will honor and cherish her as my own." The dwarfs were moved by the prince's words, and gave him the coffin. The prince had it carried on the shoulders of his servants, and as they were walking, they stumbled, and the poison from the apple core was shaken out of Snow White's throat. She opened her eyes, and sat up, and was alive again. "Oh God, where am I?" she said. The prince said, "You are with me," and told her what had happened, and said, "I love you more than all the world, and I want you to be my wife." Snow White agreed, and went with the prince, and their wedding was celebrated with great pomp and ceremony.

The wicked queen, however, was invited to the wedding, and when she looked at herself in the mirror, she said:

"Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who is the fairest one of all?"

The mirror replied:

"You, O Queen, are the fairest here,
but the young queen is a thousand times more beautiful than you."

The wicked queen was shocked, and was so angry that she could not control herself. She wanted to go to the wedding, but she could not bear the thought of seeing Snow White. But she was forced to go, and when she saw Snow White, she recognized her, and was so frightened that she could not move. But the prince had prepared a surprise for her, and had placed iron shoes on hot coals, and had them brought in, and placed them before her. She was forced to dance in the shoes until she died.

And so Snow White finally found peace, and the wicked queen was punished for her cruelty.
