There once was a fisherman and his wife, who lived together in a small hut, close to the sea. The fisherman went out every day to fish, and he fished and fished.

One day, as he sat by the water with his line, he looked into the clear water and sat and sat. The line went down deep into the water, and when he pulled it up, he pulled up a large fish. The fish spoke to him, “Ah, good fisherman, I beg of you, let me live, I am not a real fish, I am a cursed prince. What good does it do you to kill me? I would not taste good to you anyway: put me back in the water and let me swim.” “Now,” said the fisherman, “you talk too much, a fish that can speak, I would have put back in the water anyway.” With that, he put it back in the clear water, and the fish went down to the bottom and left a long stream of blood behind it. The fisherman then stood up and went back to his hut.

“Husband,” said his wife, “have you caught anything today?” “No,” said the fisherman, “I caught a fish that said it was a cursed prince, so I put it back in the water.” “Did you not wish for anything?” said the wife. “No,” said the fisherman, “what should I wish for?” “Ah,” said the wife, “it would be better if you were always fishing in the hut, it stinks and is so disgusting: you could have wished for a small hut. Go back and call it, say that we want a small hut.” “Ah,” said the fisherman, “what should I go back for?” “Yes,” said the wife, “you caught it and put it back in the water, it will certainly do it.” The fisherman did not want to go back, but his wife would not let him stay, and he went back to the sea.

As he came back, the sea was completely green and yellow, and not as clear as before. So he stood there and said

“Manntje, Manntje, Timpe Te,
Buttje, Buttje in der See,
myne Fru de Jlsebill
will nich so as ik wol will.”

Do the fish came swimming up and said “what does she want?” “Ah,” said the fisherman, “she wants a small hut.” “Go and tell her,” said the fish, “she has it all.”

The fisherman went back, and his wife was no longer sitting in the hut, but there was a small hut, and his wife was sitting in front of the door on a bench. Then his wife took him by the hand and said “come here, now it is much better.” They went inside, and in the hut was a small courtyard and a lovely garden and a room, where they had a bed, and a kitchen and a pantry, all equipped with the best things, and decorated with the finest things, and tinware and silverware, that you could hear. And behind was also a small farm with chickens and geese, and a small orchard with greenery and fruit. “See,” said the wife, “is it not nice?” “Yes,” said the fisherman, “so it shall remain, now we shall be content to live here.” “We shall think about it,” said the wife, and they ate something and went to bed.

After eight or fourteen days, the wife said “look, the hut is too small, and the farm and the orchard is so small: the fish could have given us a larger house. I want to live in a large stone castle, go back to the fish and tell it that we want a castle.” “Ah, wife,” said the fisherman, “the hut is good enough, what do we want in a castle?” “Yes, what,” said the wife, “go back and tell the fish that it can do it.” “No, wife,” said the fisherman, “the fish gave us the hut first, I do not want to go back to it again, the fish will be tired of it.” “Go, go,” said the wife, “it can do it easily and will certainly do it; go back and tell it.” The fisherman’s heart was heavy, and he did not want to go back, but he said to himself “this is not right,” and he went back anyway.

As he came back to the sea, the water was completely dark and murky, and not as green and yellow as before, but it was still calm. So he stood there and said

“Manntje, Manntje, Timpe Te,
Buttje, Buttje in der See,
myne Fru de Jlsebill
will nich so as ik wol will.”

“Now, what does she want?” said the fish. “Ah,” said the fisherman, “she wants to live in a large stone castle.” “Go and tell her,” said the fish, “she is waiting at the door.”

The fisherman went back, and as he came, there was a large stone castle in front of him, and his wife was standing at the door. Then his wife took him by the hand and said “come inside.” With that, they went inside, and in the castle was a large hall with marble floors, and there were so many servants who opened the large doors, and the walls were all white and decorated with beautiful tapestries, and in the rooms were golden stools and dishes, and crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling, and all the rooms were decorated with footstools. And behind the house was also a large farm with horses and stables, and carriages on the best, and also a large beautiful garden with the most beautiful flowers and fine fruit trees, and a pleasure garden a half mile long, where there were deer and rabbits and hares, and everything that you could wish for. “Now,” said the wife, “is it not beautiful?” “Ah, yes,” said the fisherman, “so it shall remain, now we shall live in the beautiful castle and be content.” “We shall think about it,” said the wife, “and we shall go to bed.”

The next morning, the wife woke up first, and looked out of the window at the beautiful land before her. The fisherman stretched himself, and then she pushed him with her elbow in the side and said “husband, get up and look out the window. See, can we not become king of all this land? Go back to the fish and tell it that we want to be king.” “Ah, wife,” said the fisherman, “what do we want to be king? I do not want to be king.” “Now,” said the wife, “if you do not want to be king, I will be king. Go back to the fish and tell it that I want to be king.” “Ah, wife,” said the fisherman, “what do you want to be king for? I do not want to tell the fish that.” “Why not?” said the wife, “go straight back, I must be king.” The fisherman did not want to go back, but he went back anyway.

And when he came to the sea, the water was completely black and murky, and the water was boiling up from the bottom, and it was also very smelly. So he stood there and said

“Manntje, Manntje, Timpe Te,
Buttje, Buttje in der See,
myne Fru de Jlsebill
will nich so as ik wol will.”

“Now, what does she want?” said the fish. “Ah,” said the fisherman, “she wants to be king.” “Go and tell her,” said the fish, “she is it all.”

The fisherman went back, and when he came to the castle, it was much larger than before, with a large tower and a beautiful courtyard, and the guards were standing at the door, and there were so many soldiers and drums and trumpets. And when he went inside, everything was made of pure marble with gold, and the doors were opened by the entire court, and his wife was sitting on a high throne made of gold and diamonds, and she had a large golden crown on her head, and the scepter in her hand made of pure gold and precious stones, and on both sides of her stood six pages in a row, each one smaller than the other. Then he stood there and said “ah, wife, are you now king?” “Yes,” said the wife, “I am king.” Then he stood there and looked at her, and when he looked at her for a long time, he said “ah, wife, how beautiful it is if you are king! Now we shall want nothing more.” “No, husband,” said the wife, “my time has come and gone, I can no longer hold it in. Go back to the fish and tell it that I am king, now I must also be emperor.” “Ah, wife,” said the fisherman, “what do you want to be emperor for?” “Husband,” said the wife, “go back to the fish and tell it that I want to be emperor.” “Ah, wife,” said the fisherman, “the fish cannot make an emperor, I do not want to tell the fish that; an emperor is once in the empire, the fish cannot make an emperor, that is impossible.” “What,” said the wife, “I am king and you are my husband, will you not go back? Will you not go back and tell the fish that I want to be emperor?” The fisherman had to go back. When the fisherman went back, he was very afraid, and as he went, he thought to himself “this is not going to end well: the fish will get tired of it.”

With that, he came to the sea, and the water was completely black and murky, and it was boiling up from the bottom, and it was spewing out bubbles, and a strong wind was blowing over it, and the fisherman was gray. So he stood there and said

“Manntje, Manntje, Timpe Te,
Buttje, Buttje in der See,
myne Fru de Jlsebill
will nich so as ik wol will.”

“Now, what does she want?” said the fish. “Ah,” said the fisherman, “my wife wants to be emperor.” “Go and tell her,” said the fish, “she is it all.”

The fisherman went back, and when he came, the entire castle was made of polished marble with golden decorations and golden crowns. In front of the door, the soldiers were marching, and they were blowing trumpets and beating drums and cymbals: but inside the house, the barons and counts and dukes were behaving like servants, and they opened the doors made of pure gold. And when he came inside, his wife was sitting on a throne made of a single piece of gold, and it was two miles high, and she had a large golden crown on her head, which was three ells high and decorated with diamonds and precious stones, and in one hand she held the scepter and in the other hand the imperial orb, and on both sides of her stood the attendants in two rows, each one smaller than the other, from the largest to the smallest, and in front of her stood many princes and dukes. Then the fisherman stood there and said “wife, are you now emperor?” “Yes,” said the wife, “I am emperor.” Then he stood there and looked at her, and when he looked at her for a long time, he said “ah, wife, how beautiful it is if you are emperor!” “Husband,” said the wife, “what are you doing? I am now emperor, now I want to also be pope.” “Ah, wife,” said the fisherman, “what do you want to be pope for? The pope is once in the Christian faith, the fish cannot make a pope.” “Husband,” said the wife, “I want to be pope, go back to the fish and tell it that I want to be pope.” “No, wife,” said the fisherman, “this is not right, this is not right,” and he thought to himself “this is getting too much, the fish will get tired of it.”

With that, he came to the sea, and the water was completely black and murky, and it was boiling up from the bottom, and it was spewing out bubbles, and a strong wind was blowing over it, and the fisherman was gray. So he stood there and said

“Manntje, Manntje, Timpe Te,
Buttje, Buttje in der See,
myne Fru de Jlsebill
will nich so as ik wol will.”

“Now, what does she want?” said the fish. “Ah,” said the fisherman, “she wants to be pope.” “Go and tell her,” said the fish, “she is it all.”

The fisherman went back, and when he came, there was a large church made of pure marble, and it was surrounded by a palace. He pushed his way through the crowd, and inside it was all lit up with thousands and thousands of lights, and his wife was sitting on a throne made of pure gold, and she was even higher than before, and she had three large golden crowns on her head, and around her were many members of the clergy, and on both sides of her stood two rows of lights, the largest one as big as the largest tower, and the smallest one as small as a candle flame, and all the kings and emperors who were lying at her feet were kissing her ring. “Wife,” said the fisherman, and looked at her, “are you now pope?” “Yes,” said the wife, “I am pope.” Then he stood there and looked at her, and when he looked at her for a long time, he said “ah, wife, how beautiful it is if you are pope!” But the wife was as stiff as a tree, and she did not stir or stir, and then he said “wife, now you are content, now you can no longer become anything else.” “We shall think about it,” said the wife, and they both went to bed, but the wife was not content, and her greed would not let her sleep, and she thought all night long what she could still become, and what she could still achieve.

The fisherman slept soundly and fast, he had walked a lot during the day, but the wife could not sleep well, and she tossed and turned all night long, and thought all the time what she could still become, and what she could still achieve. With that, the sun was rising, and when she saw the morning light, she sat up in bed and looked out the window, and when she saw the sun rising, she thought “ha, I can also make the sun and the moon rise?” “Husband,” said she, and pushed him with her elbow in the side, “wake up, go back to the fish and tell it that I want to be God.” The fisherman was still half asleep, but he was startled and got out of bed. He thought he had been warned, and he rubbed his eyes and said “ah, wife, what are you saying?” “Husband,” said the wife, “if I cannot make the sun and the moon rise, and I must see it rise, I can no longer be content, and I will not have a peaceful moment, until I can make the sun and the moon rise myself.” Then she looked at him with a fierce look, and he was so frightened that he could not hear his own words.

“Go back, go back,” said the wife, “I want to be God.” “Ah, wife,” said the fisherman, and fell to his knees, “do not go, stay pope, I beg of you.” Then she went into a frenzy, and her hair flew wildly around her head, and she grabbed her life and said “I will not hold back, and I will not hold back, will you go? Will you go?” Then she threw him off and he ran away like a madman.

But outside, the storm was raging, and it was so strong that he could hardly stand on his feet: the houses and trees were blown over, and the boats were tossed about, and the rocks were rolling into the sea, and the sky was completely black, and lightning flashed, and the sea was boiling up in huge black waves like church towers and boats, and they had a white crown of foam on top. Then he shouted, and he could not hear his own words,

“Manntje, Manntje, Timpe Te,
Buttje, Buttje in der See,
myne Fru de Jlsebill
will nich so as ik wol will.”

“Now, what does she want?” said the fish. “Ah,” said the fisherman, “she wants to be God.” “Go and tell her,” said the fish, “she is back in the hut.”

And they still sit there today and on this day.
