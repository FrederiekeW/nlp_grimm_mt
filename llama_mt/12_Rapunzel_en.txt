Once upon a time, there was a man and a woman who had long wished in vain for a child. At last, the woman began to hope that the dear God would grant their wish. The people had a small window in the back of their house, through which one could see into a beautiful garden filled with the most beautiful flowers and herbs. However, the garden was surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to enter, for it belonged to a sorceress who had great power and was feared by everyone. One day, the woman stood at this window and looked down into the garden, where she saw a bed planted with the most beautiful rapunzels. And they looked so fresh and green that she became lusting and had the greatest longing to eat them. The longing grew stronger every day, and since she knew she could not get any, she fell completely ill, looking pale and miserable. Then the man was frightened and asked, "What's wrong with you, dear wife?" "Ah," she replied, "if I don't get some rapunzels from the garden behind our house to eat, I will die." The man, who loved her, thought, "Before you die, I'll get some for you, no matter what it costs." In the evening twilight, he climbed over the wall into the sorceress's garden, plucked a handful of rapunzels in haste, and brought them to his wife. She immediately made a salad of them and ate them with great eagerness. They tasted so good that she had the same longing the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that. Should she have any rest, the man had to climb over the wall again. He did so in the evening twilight, but as he climbed down the wall, he was greatly frightened, for he saw the sorceress standing before him. "How dare you," she said with a furious look, "climb into my garden and steal my rapunzels like a thief? You will pay for it." "Ah," the man replied, "have mercy, for I did it out of necessity: my wife saw the rapunzels from the window and felt such a great longing that she would have died if she hadn't eaten them." The sorceress's anger subsided, and she said to him, "If what you say is true, I will allow you to take as many rapunzels as you want, but I make one condition: you must give me the child that your wife will bring into the world. I will take care of it and treat it like my own child." The man, in his fear, agreed to everything, and when the woman was pregnant, the sorceress appeared immediately, gave the child the name Rapunzel, and took it with her.

Rapunzel was the most beautiful child under the sun. When it was twelve years old, the sorceress locked it in a tower in a forest, which had no stairs or door, only a small window at the top. If the sorceress wanted to enter, she would stand below and call out, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!" Rapunzel had long, beautiful hair, fine as spun gold. When she heard the sorceress's voice, she would untie her braids, wrap them around a hook at the window, and then her hair would fall down twenty feet and the sorceress would climb up.

A few years later, it happened that the king's son rode through the forest and came to the tower. He heard a singing voice, which was so sweet that he stopped and listened. It was Rapunzel, who was entertaining herself in her loneliness by singing. The king's son wanted to climb up to her, but he couldn't find a door. He rode home, but the singing had touched his heart so much that he went out into the forest every day and listened. One day, as he stood behind a tree, he saw the sorceress coming and heard her call out, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!" Rapunzel let down her hair, and the sorceress climbed up. "Is that the ladder by which one can climb up?" she said, "then I'll try it too." The next day, as it began to get dark, the king's son came to the tower and called out, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!" Immediately, her hair fell down, and the king's son climbed up.

At first, Rapunzel was greatly frightened when a man came into her room, but her eyes had never seen one like him. The king's son began to speak to her in a friendly manner and told her that her singing had touched his heart so much that he had to see her. Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would marry him, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought, "He will love me more than the old sorceress," and said yes and put her hand in his. They agreed that he would come to her every evening, for during the day the sorceress would come. The sorceress noticed nothing, until one day Rapunzel began to speak to her and said, "Tell her, Frau Gothel, how come it's so hard for her to climb up, but the young king's son can climb up so easily?" "Ah, you wicked child," the sorceress exclaimed, "what am I hearing? I thought I had separated you from the world, and you've betrayed me!" In her anger, she seized Rapunzel's beautiful hair, slapped it a few times with her left hand, grabbed a pair of scissors with her right hand, and snipped, snipped, and it was cut off, and the beautiful braids lay on the ground. She was so merciless that she took Rapunzel to a desert and left her there to live in great misery and wretchedness.

On the same day that she had banished Rapunzel, the sorceress fastened the cut-off braids to the hook at the window and, when the king's son came and called out, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!" Rapunzel let down her hair, and the king's son climbed up, but he found the sorceress instead of his beloved Rapunzel, who looked at him with evil and poisonous glances. "Ha!" she cackled, "you want to fetch your beloved, but the beautiful bird has flown the coop, and the cat has caught it and will scratch out your eyes too. Rapunzel is lost to you, and you'll never see her again." The king's son was overcome with grief and, in his despair, jumped out of the tower, and his life was spared, but the thorns he fell into pierced his eyes. He wandered blindly through the forest, eating nothing but roots and berries, and crying and lamenting over the loss of his beloved wife. He wandered for several years in misery and finally came to the desert, where Rapunzel lived with her twins, a boy and a girl, in poverty. He heard a voice, and it seemed familiar to him, and he went towards it, and when he came closer, he recognized Rapunzel and fell into her arms, weeping. Two of her tears fell on his eyes, and they became clear again, and he could see with them as before. He took her to his kingdom, where he was welcomed with joy, and they lived happily and contentedly for a long time. And so, Rapunzel is the name of a child who was locked in a tower by a sorceress and loved by a king's son.
