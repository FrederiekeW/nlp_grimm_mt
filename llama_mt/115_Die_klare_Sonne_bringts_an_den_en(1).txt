A journeyman tailor traveled the world in search of work, and one day he couldn’t find any and was so poor that he had no money at all. At that time, he met a Jew on the road, and he thought he had a lot of money on him, so he pushed God out of his heart, went on him, and said, ‘Give me your money, or I’ll kill you.’ The Jew said, ‘Save my life, I don’t have any money and only eight pence.’ The tailor, however, said, ‘You have money, and it will come out,’ and he used force and beat him until he was near death. And when the Jew was about to die, he said his last words, ‘The clear sun will bring it to light!’ and died with those words. The journeyman tailor grabbed him and searched his pockets, but he only found the eight pence that the Jew had said he had. He then picked him up, carried him behind a bush, and continued on his journey. After a long time, he came to a city and found work with a master tailor, who had a beautiful daughter that he fell in love with and married. They lived a happy and contented life together.

After a long time, when they already had two children, the tailor’s father-in-law and mother-in-law died, and the young couple had to manage the household alone. One morning, as the man was sitting at the table in front of the window, his wife brought him his coffee, and when he had poured it into the saucer and was about to drink, the sun shone on it and the reflection sparkled on the wall, making circles. The tailor looked up and said, ‘Yes, it wants to bring it to light, but can’t!’ His wife said, ‘Oh dear man, what is it? What do you mean by that?’ He replied, ‘I shouldn’t tell you that.’ But she pressed him, saying, ‘If you love me, you must tell me,’ and she used the most persuasive words, promising that no one else would ever hear it, and she wouldn’t rest until he told her. So he told her the story of how, many years ago, he had been a wandering tailor with no money and had beaten a Jew to death, and the Jew had said in his last moments, ‘The clear sun will bring it to light!’ Now the sun had wanted to bring it to light, but couldn’t. He begged her to keep the secret, promising that if she told anyone, he would lose his life. She promised to keep it secret, but as soon as he had sat down to work, she went to her aunt and told her the story, with the promise that no one else would ever hear it. But before three days had passed, the whole town knew about it, and the tailor was brought before the court and judged. And in the end, the clear sun brought it to light.
