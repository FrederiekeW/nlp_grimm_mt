Once upon a time, there was a man who had a long journey ahead of him, and as he was leaving, he asked his three daughters what he should bring back for them. The eldest wanted pearls, the second wanted diamonds, but the youngest said, ‘Dear father, I wish for a singing, jumping lark.’ The father said, ‘Yes, if I can get it, I will bring it for you,’ kissed all three, and set off. When the time came for him to return home, he had bought pearls and diamonds for the two eldest, but he had searched everywhere for the singing, jumping lark for the youngest, and it pained him, for she was his dearest child.

As he was walking through a forest, he came across a magnificent castle, and near the castle stood a tree, and on the top of the tree he saw a lark singing and jumping. ‘Ah, you come just in time!’ he exclaimed, and called to his servant to climb up and catch the bird. But as he approached the tree, a lion sprang out from under it, shook itself, and roared so loudly that the leaves on the trees trembled. ‘Whoever wants to steal my singing, jumping lark from me will be eaten!’ he bellowed.

The man said, ‘I didn’t know the bird belonged to you; I will make amends for my wrongdoing and pay a heavy ransom to buy my life.’ The lion replied, ‘Nothing can save you except if you promise to give me whatever you first encounter at home; if you agree to do this, I will give you your life and the bird as a gift for your daughter on top of it.’ The man refused, saying, ‘It could be my youngest daughter, who loves me the most and runs to meet me when I come home.’ His servant was afraid and said, ‘Must it be your daughter? It could be a cat or a dog!’ The man was convinced, took the singing, jumping lark, and promised the lion that he would give him whatever he first encountered at home.

When he arrived home, the first thing he encountered was none other than his youngest, dearest daughter, who came running, kissed, and hugged him, and when she saw that he had brought a singing, jumping lark, she was overjoyed. But the father couldn’t be happy; he began to weep and said, ‘My dearest child, I bought the little bird at great cost; I had to promise a wild lion that he could have you, and if he gets you, he will tear you apart and eat you.’ He told her everything that had happened and begged her not to go, but she comforted him and said, ‘Dear father, what you promised must be kept; I will go and try to calm the lion down, so that I can return to you safely.’

The next morning, she set off, accompanied by a servant, and entered the forest, where the lion lived. The lion was a prince who had been enchanted and was a lion by day, but at night, he and his people returned to their human form. When she arrived, she was received kindly and taken into the castle. At night, the lion transformed back into a handsome prince, and they got married with great pomp and ceremony.

They lived happily together, sleeping during the day and waking at night. One day, the prince came to her and said, ‘Tomorrow is a feast at your father’s house, because your eldest sister is getting married, and if you want to go, my lions will escort you.’ She agreed, and they went to the feast, where everyone was overjoyed to see her, thinking she had been eaten by the lion and was dead. She told them about her handsome prince and how happy she was, and stayed with them for the duration of the wedding.

When her second sister got married, she asked the prince to come with her, but he refused, saying it was too dangerous, for if the light of a burning candle touched him, he would be transformed into a dove and would have to fly with the doves for seven years. ‘Oh,’ she said, ‘come with me; I will protect you and keep you safe from the light.’ They went together, taking their little child with them, and she had a special room built in the castle, where the prince could stay safely during the wedding. However, when they passed by the room with the candles, a beam of light fell on the prince, and he was transformed into a dove.

The dove told her, ‘I must fly away for seven years; every seven steps, I will drop a red drop of blood and a white feather, which will show you the way; follow the trail, and you can free me.’ The dove flew away, and she followed, and every seven steps, a red drop of blood and a white feather fell, guiding her on her journey. She traveled through the wide world, not looking back or resting, and almost seven years had passed when she thought they were almost free. One day, as she was walking, no red drop of blood or white feather fell, and when she looked up, the dove was gone.

She thought, ‘Humans can’t help me,’ and climbed up to the sun, saying, ‘You shine through all the crevices and over all the peaks; have you seen a white dove flying?’ The sun replied, ‘No, I haven’t seen one, but I will give you a box; open it when you are in great need.’ She thanked the sun and continued on her journey until evening, when the moon appeared, and she asked, ‘You shine through the night and over all fields and forests; have you seen a white dove flying?’ The moon replied, ‘No, I haven’t seen one, but I will give you an egg; break it when you are in great need.’ She thanked the moon and continued on her journey until the night wind blew, and she asked, ‘You blow over all the trees and under all the leaves; have you seen a white dove flying?’ The night wind replied, ‘No, I haven’t seen one, but I will ask the other three winds if they have seen it.’ The east wind and the west wind replied that they hadn’t seen it, but the south wind said, ‘I saw the white dove flying to the red sea; there, it has become a lion again, for the seven years are up, and the lion is fighting a Lindworm there, which is a princess who has been enchanted.’ The night wind told her, ‘I will give you advice; go to the red sea, and on the right shore, there are great reeds; count them, and when you reach the eleventh, cut it off; use it to strike the Lindworm, and the lion will be able to defeat it; then, look around, and you will see the bird of prey, the Griffin, sitting on the red sea; climb onto its back with your beloved, and the bird will carry you across the sea to your home.’ The night wind also gave her a nut, saying, ‘When you are in the middle of the sea, drop it; as soon as it falls, a great nut tree will grow out of the water, and the Griffin will rest on it; if it couldn’t rest, it wouldn’t be strong enough to carry you; and if you forget to drop the nut, the Griffin will drop you into the sea.’

She followed the night wind’s advice and found everything as he had said. She counted the reeds on the shore, cut off the eleventh, and struck the Lindworm with it; the lion defeated it, and both regained their human form. The princess, who had been a Lindworm, took the young man in her arms, sat on the Griffin, and flew away with him. The poor woman, who had been searching for her beloved for seven years, was left behind and sat down to weep. She comforted herself, saying, ‘I will go as far as the wind blows and as long as the rooster crows, until I find him.’ She traveled for a long time, and finally arrived at the castle where her beloved lived. She heard that they were planning to get married and have a feast, and she thought, ‘God help me!’ and opened the box that the sun had given her. Inside, she found a golden dress, shining like the sun itself. She put it on and went to the castle, where everyone, including the bride, looked at her in amazement. The bride was so taken with the dress that she asked if it was for sale, but the woman replied, ‘Not for gold or riches, but for flesh and blood.’ The bride asked what she meant, and the woman said, ‘Let me sleep in the room where the groom sleeps tonight.’ The bride agreed, but the groom’s servant had to give him a sleeping draught, just in case.

That night, the woman was taken to the room, and when she began to tell the groom about her seven-year-long search and how she had been helped by the sun, the moon, and the night wind, he recognized her voice and sprang up, saying, ‘Now I am truly free; it seemed like a dream, for the enchanted princess had cast a spell on me, making me forget you, but God has taken it away from me at the right moment.’ They slipped out of the castle that night, afraid of the groom’s father, who was a sorcerer, and climbed onto the Griffin, which carried them over the red sea. When they were in the middle of the sea, the woman dropped the nut, and a great nut tree grew out of the water, on which the Griffin rested. Then, it carried them to their home, where they found their child, now grown and beautiful. They lived happily ever after, and when they grew old, they had a tomb built, with the inscription: ‘Here lie the lovers who cried out for each other for seven years.’
