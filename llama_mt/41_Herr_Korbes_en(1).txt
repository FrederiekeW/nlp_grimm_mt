There was once a chicken and a cockerel who wanted to make a journey together. So the cockerel built a beautiful carriage with four red wheels, and harnessed four mice to it. The chicken sat with the cockerel and they drove off together. Not long after, they met a cat who said ‘where are you off to?’ The cockerel replied,

‘Out
to the Lord of the Corn Bin’s house.’

‘Take me with you’ said the cat. The cockerel replied ‘very gladly, sit at the back, so you don’t fall off at the front.

Take care
not to make my red wheels dirty.
You wheels, turn,
you mice, whistle,
out
to the Lord of the Corn Bin’s house.’

Then a millstone came, then an egg, then a duck, then a sewing needle, and finally a sewing thimble, who all sat on the carriage and drove off with them. When they arrived at the Lord of the Corn Bin’s house, the Lord of the Corn Bin was not there. The mice drove the carriage into the barn, the chicken flew with the cockerel onto a beam, the cat sat in the chimney, the duck in the well bucket, the egg wrapped itself in a towel,
the sewing needle stuck itself into the chair cushion, the sewing thimble sprang onto the bed in the middle of the pillow, and the millstone lay across the door. Then the Lord of the Corn Bin came home, went to the chimney and wanted to light a fire, but the cat threw ash into his face. He ran quickly to the kitchen and wanted to wash his face, but the duck sprayed water in his face. He wanted to dry himself with a towel, but the egg rolled towards him, broke and stuck his eyes together. He wanted to rest, and sat down on a chair, but the sewing needle stuck him. He grew angry, and threw himself onto the bed, but as he laid his head on the pillow, the sewing thimble stuck him, so that he shouted and ran wildly out into the world. But when he came to the front door, the millstone fell down and killed him. The Lord of the Corn Bin must have been a very wicked man.
