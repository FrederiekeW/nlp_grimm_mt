Once upon a time, there was a king who was sick, and no one believed he would survive. He had three sons, who were deeply troubled, went down to the castle garden, and wept. An old man encountered them and asked about their sorrow. They told him their father was so sick that he would likely die, as nothing seemed to help him. The old man said, "I know of a remedy that might work. If he drinks the water of life, he will recover. But it's hard to find." The eldest son said, "I'll find it," went to the ailing king, and begged him to let him go out and search for the water, as it might be the only thing that could save him. "No," the king said, "the danger is too great. I'd rather die." But he begged him for so long that the king finally agreed.

The prince thought to himself, "If I bring back the water of life, I'll be the most beloved son, and I'll inherit the kingdom." So he set out, and after a while, he encountered a dwarf on the road who asked him where he was hurrying off to. "Foolish little creature," the prince said, "you don't need to know that." And he rode off without looking back. The dwarf, however, was angry and made a wish that would bring the prince misfortune. The prince soon found himself in a narrow mountain pass, and the closer he got to the end, the narrower the pass became. He couldn't turn his horse or get off, and he was trapped.

The king waited a long time for the prince, but he didn't return. The second son then said, "Father, let me go out and search for the water," and he thought to himself, "If my brother doesn't return, the kingdom will be mine." The king was hesitant at first, but eventually agreed. The second son set out on the same path as his brother and encountered the dwarf, who asked him the same question. "Foolish little creature," the prince said, "you don't need to know that." And he rode off without looking back. The dwarf, however, was angry again and made another wish that would bring the prince misfortune. The second prince soon found himself in the same predicament as his brother, trapped in the mountain pass.

The youngest son then said, "Father, let me go out and search for the water," and the king finally agreed. The youngest son set out on the same path as his brothers and encountered the dwarf, who asked him the same question. This time, the prince stopped and said, "I'm searching for the water of life, because my father is dying." "Do you know where it is?" the dwarf asked. "No," the prince replied. "Because you behaved yourself properly, and not like your two foolish brothers, I'll give you some advice. The water of life flows from a well in the courtyard of a cursed castle. But you won't be able to get to it unless I give you an iron rod and two loaves of bread. With the rod, you can strike the iron gate of the castle three times, and it will open. Inside, you'll find two lions that will open their jaws when you give them each a loaf of bread. Then, you can take some of the water of life before it's too late."

The prince thanked the dwarf, took the rod and bread, and set off. Everything the dwarf had told him came true, and the prince was able to get to the well and take some of the water of life. He then met a beautiful princess who was trapped in the castle, and she thanked him for rescuing her and said she would wait for him for a year before marrying him. She also told him where the well was, but warned him to hurry and get the water before it was too late.

The prince continued on his journey and eventually came to a land where there was hunger and war. The king of the land was in a state of despair, and the prince gave him the bread, which fed and satisfied the entire kingdom. He then gave the king the sword, with which he was able to defeat his enemies and live in peace and prosperity. The prince took the bread and sword back, and the three brothers continued on their journey.

They came to two more lands where there was hunger and war, and the prince gave the bread and sword to the kings of those lands, saving them as well. After that, the brothers set sail across the sea. During the journey, the two eldest brothers spoke to each other in secret, saying, "The youngest brother found the water of life, and we didn't. Our father will give him the kingdom, and he'll take our happiness away." They became jealous and plotted to harm their brother. They waited until he was fast asleep, and then they poured the water of life out of his cup and took it for themselves, replacing it with bitter sea water.

When they returned home, the youngest brother brought the cup to their father, saying it was the water of life. But as soon as the old king took a sip, he became even sicker than before. The two eldest brothers accused the youngest of trying to poison their father, saying they had brought the real water of life. The old king was furious and ordered the youngest brother to be killed.

The youngest brother, however, had already made friends with a hunter who was tasked with killing him. The hunter, however, couldn't bring himself to do it and told the prince that he would spare his life if he gave him his royal clothes. The prince agreed, and the hunter took his clothes and left. The prince then continued on his way, and after a while, three wagons arrived at the old king's court, bearing gold and precious stones for the youngest brother. They were from the three kings who had been saved by the prince's sword and bread, and they wanted to show their gratitude.

The old king was moved by the gift and realized that he might have been too hasty in condemning his youngest son. The hunter, who had been watching from the sidelines, spoke up and told the king what had really happened. The king was overcome with remorse and ordered a proclamation to be made throughout the land, saying that his youngest son was welcome to return and would be forgiven.

The princess, who had been waiting for the prince, had a golden road built leading up to her castle, and she told her people that whoever rode straight down the road would be the true prince, and she would marry him. Anyone who rode alongside the road would be a imposter, and they should not be admitted. When the time came, the two eldest brothers rode up to the castle, but they were both too proud to ride straight down the road. They rode alongside it, and when they arrived at the castle, they were told they were not the true prince and should leave.

The youngest brother, who had been waiting in the woods, finally rode up to the castle, and his horse rode straight down the golden road. The castle gates opened, and the princess welcomed him with joy, saying he was her true rescuer and the ruler of the kingdom. They were married with great celebration, and the old king was overjoyed to see his youngest son happy.

As the wedding celebrations came to an end, the princess told the prince that his father had forgiven him and invited him to come home. The prince told his father everything that had happened, including how his brothers had betrayed him and how he had kept quiet about it. The old king was angry with his sons, but they had already set sail across the sea and were never seen again. And so the story came to an end.
