There was once a poor farmer who had no land, only a small cottage and a single daughter. The daughter said, “We should ask the Lord King for a little patch of moorland.” When the king heard of their poverty, he gave them a small corner of grass, which they tilled and sowed with a little corn and fruit. Just as they were almost finished with the field, they found a small pig of pure gold in the earth. “Hear, Father,” said the daughter, “since our Lord King has been so gracious and given us this field, we must give him the pig as a gift.” But the daughter did not want to give it up, and said, “Father, if we have the pig and not the sow, then we must also bring the sow. So, be quiet and do not say anything.” But the father would not listen to her, took the pig, and carried it to the Lord King, saying that he had found it in the heath, and asked if he would accept it as a gift. The king took the pig and asked if he had found anything else. “No,” replied the farmer. Then the king said that he should now also bring the sow. The farmer said that they had not found it, but this helped him nothing, for he was thrown into prison and was to sit there until he brought the sow. The servants had to bring him water and bread every day, which was all he got in the prison. They heard the man crying out, “Oh, if only I had listened to my daughter! Oh, if only I had listened to my daughter!” The servants went to the king and told him how the prisoner was crying out, “Oh, if only I had listened to my daughter!” and would not eat or drink. The king ordered the servants to bring the prisoner before him, and asked him why he was crying out, “Oh, if only I had listened to my daughter!” “What did your daughter say?” asked the king. “Yes, she said that I should not bring the pig, or I would have to bring the sow,” replied the farmer. “Do you have such a clever daughter, let her come here.” So the daughter had to come before the king, who asked her if she was so clever, and said that he would give her a riddle, and if she could solve it, he would marry her. “Yes,” said the daughter, “I want to solve it.” “Come to me,” said the king, “not dressed, not naked, not riding, not driven, not on the road, not off the road, and if you can do this, I will marry you.” The daughter went, undressed herself, and put on a large fishnet, and wrapped it all around her. She borrowed an ass for money, and tied the fishnet to the ass’s tail, and it had to pull her along. She was not riding, nor was she driven, nor was she on the road, nor off the road. And when she came before the king, he said that she had solved the riddle, and that everything was fulfilled. He released the father from prison, and took the daughter as his wife, and ordered her to manage the entire royal estate.

Many years had passed, when the Lord King once rode out on a procession, and it happened that farmers with their carts stopped before the castle, who had sold wood; some had oxen harnessed, and some had horses. There was a farmer who had three horses, one of which got a young foal, which ran away and lay down in the middle of two oxen that were in front of a cart. When the farmers gathered, they began to quarrel, to throw and to make a commotion, and the oxen farmer wanted to keep the foal and said that the oxen had it. The other said no, his horses had it, and it was his. The quarrel came before the king, and he made a judgment, saying that the foal should stay where it was. And so the oxen farmer got it, although it did not belong to him. The other farmer went away, weeping and lamenting over his foal. Now he had heard how the Queen was so gracious, because she too came from poor farmers, and he went to her and begged her to help him get his foal back. She said, “Yes, if you promise not to betray me, I will tell you. Tomorrow morning, when the king is on the watch parade, you should stand in the middle of the street, where he has to pass, take a large fishnet, and pretend to fish, and fish as if you had caught something, and then throw the net out as if it were full.” And she also told him what to say if the king asked him. So the farmer stood there the next day and fished on a dry place. When the king came by and saw it, he sent a runner to ask what the foolish man was doing. The farmer replied, “I am fishing.” The runner asked how he could fish, since there was no water there. The farmer said, “Just as two oxen can get a foal, so can I also fish on dry land.” The runner went and brought the king the answer, and the king ordered the farmer to come before him, and said to him, “You did not come up with this on your own, but from whom did you get it?” And he ordered him to confess it immediately. But the farmer would not do it, and kept saying, “God save me, I got it from myself.” They put him on a bundle of straw and beat and tormented him until he confessed that he had gotten it from the Queen. When the king came home, he said to his wife, “Why have you been so unfaithful to me? I do not want you to be my wife any longer. Your time is up, go back to where you came from, to your farmer’s cottage.” But he allowed her to take one thing, that she knew she could take with her, and that would be her farewell. She said, “Yes, dear husband, if you command it, I will do it.” And she fell upon him and kissed him, and said she wanted to take her farewell from him. Then she had a strong sleeping draught brought, and they drank it together as a farewell. The king took a large drink, but she only took a little. And when she saw that he was falling into a deep sleep, she called a servant and took a beautiful white linen cloth, and wrapped him in it, and the servants had to carry him in a carriage to the door, and she took him home to her cottage. She put him in her bed, and he slept day and night, and when he awoke, he looked around and said, “Oh God, where am I?” He called his servant, but there was none there. Finally, his wife came to the bed and said, “Dear King, you commanded me to take the dearest and best thing from the castle with me, and I have taken nothing better or dearer than you, so I have taken you with me.” The king’s tears welled up in his eyes, and he said, “Dear wife, you shall be mine, and I yours,” and he took her back to the royal castle and married her again. And they probably still live to this day. The Queen was not unfaithful, but clever, and has repaid the king for his injustice.
