Between the world and the sea, where a man lived, and the present knoll, which had three sons, one was blind, the other was lame, and the third was splint-armed. They went one day over the field, where they saw a hare. The blind one shot and, the lame one fished and, the naked one stabbed and in the thistles. They came to a great powerful water, where there were three ships on it, one that ran, one that sank, and the third, where there was no bottom in it. Where there was no bottom in it, they all three went in. They came to a great powerful wall (forest), where there was a great powerful tree in it, in the tree was a great powerful chapel, in the chapel was a holy-minded priest and a repentant pastor, who divided the holy water with whips.

Blessed is the man,
who can escape the holy water.
