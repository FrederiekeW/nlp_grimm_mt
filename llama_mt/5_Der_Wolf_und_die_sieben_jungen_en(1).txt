Once upon a time there was an old goose who had seven young goslings, and she loved them as a mother loves her children. One day she wanted to go into the forest to gather food, so she called all seven of them and said, ‘dear children, I’m going out into the forest, be on your guard against the wolf, if he comes in, he’ll eat you all up with feathers and all. The scoundrel often disguises himself, but you’ll recognize him by his rough voice and his black feet.’ The goslings said, ‘dear mother, we’ll take care of ourselves, you can go without worrying.’ Then the old goose meckered and set off with a clear conscience.

It didn’t take long before someone knocked on the door and called out, ‘open up, you dear children, your mother has come and has brought something for each of you.’ But the goslings recognized the wolf by his rough voice and said, ‘we won’t open up, you’re not our mother, she has a fine and pleasant voice, but your voice is rough; you’re the wolf.’ The wolf went away to a grocer and bought a large piece of chalk. He ate it and made his voice fine. Then he came back, knocked on the door, and called out, ‘open up, you dear children, your mother has come and has brought something for each of you.’ But the wolf had put his black paw in the window, and the goslings saw it and said, ‘we won’t open up, our mother doesn’t have black feet like you; you’re the wolf.’ The wolf went to a baker and said, ‘I’ve hurt my foot, cover it with dough.’ And when the baker had covered his paw with dough, the wolf went to a miller and said, ‘sprinkle white flour on my paw.’ The miller thought, ‘the wolf wants to trick me,’ and refused, but the wolf said, ‘if you don’t do it, I’ll eat you.’ The miller was afraid and made his paw white. Yes, that’s what people are like.

The scoundrel went to the door for the third time, knocked, and said, ‘open up, children, your dear mother has come home and has brought something from the forest for each of you.’ The goslings said, ‘show us your paw first, so we know you’re our dear mother.’ Then he put his paw in the window, and when they saw that it was white, they believed everything he said and opened the door. But the one who came in was the wolf. They were frightened and wanted to hide. One jumped under the table, the second into bed, the third into the oven, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the washbasin, and the seventh into the clock case. But the wolf found them all and didn’t make any delay: one after the other, he swallowed them into his maw; only the youngest in the clock case he couldn’t find. When the wolf had had his fill, he went away, lay down outside on the green meadow under a tree, and began to sleep.

Not long after, the old goose came back from the forest. Oh, what a sight she saw! The door was wide open: table, chairs, and benches were overturned, the washbasin was broken, and the bed was stripped. She looked for her children, but none of them were to be found. She called them by name, one after the other, but no one answered.

Finally, when she came to the youngest, a fine voice called out, ‘dear mother, I’m stuck in the clock case.’ She pulled it out, and it told her that the wolf had come and eaten all the others. Then you can imagine how she wept over her poor children.

In her grief, she went out, and the youngest gosling followed her. When they came to the meadow, the wolf was lying under the tree and snoring so loudly that the branches were shaking. She looked at him from all sides and saw that something was moving and wriggling in his full belly. ‘Oh God,’ she thought, ‘are my poor children, whom he choked down for his supper, still alive?’ Then the gosling had to run back home and fetch scissors, needle, and thread. Then she cut open the wolf’s belly, and as soon as she had made a cut, a gosling’s head poked out, and when she cut further, one after the other, all six goslings came out, and they were all still alive, and hadn’t even suffered any harm, because the wolf had swallowed them whole in his greed. What a joy! Then they hugged their dear mother and jumped around like a tailor who’s getting married. The old goose said, ‘now go and fetch some Wackersteine, so we’ll fill the wolf’s belly with them as long as he’s still asleep.’ Then the seven goslings quickly fetched the stones and stuffed them into the wolf’s belly as much as they could. Then the old goose sewed him up quickly, so that he didn’t notice and didn’t even stir.

When the wolf finally woke up, he got up and, because the stones in his belly were making him feel thirsty, he wanted to go to a well to drink. But as he began to move and walk, the stones in his belly knocked against each other and rattled. Then he called out,

‘what’s rumbling and rattling
in my belly?
I thought it was six goslings,
but it’s all Wackersteine.’

And when he came to the well and bent over to drink, the heavy stones pulled him in, and he had to drown miserably. When the seven goslings saw this, they ran up, shouted loudly, ‘the wolf is dead! the wolf is dead!’ and danced with their mother around the well. The old goose said, ‘now he’ll learn his lesson, now he’ll see what he’s done!’ and so it was.
