Three surgeons set out into the world, thinking they had learned their art, and came to an inn, where they wanted to spend the night. The innkeeper asked where they came from and where they wanted to go. ‘We travel the world with our art.’ ‘Show me what you can do,’ said the innkeeper. Then the first one said he wanted to cut off his hand and it would heal again by morning; the second one said he wanted to rip out his heart and it would heal again by morning; the third one said he wanted to pull out his eyes and they would heal again by morning. ‘Can you do that,’ said the innkeeper, ‘then you have truly learned your art.’ But they had a salve, which they applied to the wound, and the bottle where it was stored, they carried with them at all times. So they cut off their hand, heart, and eye, as they had said they would, and put them on a plate together. The innkeeper gave them to a girl, who was to put them in the cupboard and take care of them. The girl, however, had a secret treasure, a soldier. When the innkeeper, the three surgeons, and all the people in the house were asleep, the soldier came and wanted something to eat. The girl opened the cupboard and brought him something, and in the great love, she forgot to close the cupboard door. She sat down with her lover at the table, and they talked to each other. As they sat there, carefree and not thinking about any trouble, a cat slipped in and found the cupboard open, took the hand, heart, and eyes of the three surgeons, and ran out with them. When the soldier had eaten and the girl wanted to put the things away and close the cupboard, she saw that the plate, which the innkeeper had given her, was empty. She said, frightened, to her lover, ‘Oh, what will I do, poor girl! The hand is gone, the heart and the eyes are gone too, what will happen to me tomorrow morning!’ ‘Be quiet,’ said he, ‘I will help you out of this trouble: there is a thief hanging outside, I will cut off his right hand, which hand was it?’ ‘The right one,’ said the girl. She gave him a sharp knife, and he went out, cut off the thief’s right hand, and brought it back. Then he caught the cat and poked out its eyes; now only the heart was missing. ‘Didn’t you slaughter a pig, and isn’t the pig’s meat in the cellar?’ ‘Yes,’ said the girl. ‘Well,’ said the soldier, ‘that’s good.’ He went down to the cellar and brought back a pig’s heart. The girl put everything together on the plate, and put it in the cupboard. When her lover had said goodbye, she went to bed.

The next morning, the three surgeons got up and said to the girl, ‘You should bring us the plate, where our hand, heart, and eyes are.’ She brought it out of the cupboard, and the first one held the thief’s hand and applied his salve to it; immediately it had grown back. The second one took the cat’s eyes and healed them; the third one fixed the pig’s heart. The innkeeper was standing there, admiring their skill and saying, ‘I have never seen anything like this, I will praise and recommend you to everyone.’ Then they paid their bill and continued their journey.

As they traveled on, the one with the pig’s heart didn’t stay with them, but wherever there was a corner, he went there and sniffed around, like a pig. The others tried to hold him back by the sleeve, but that didn’t help; he broke free and ran off to where the biggest mess was. The second one also behaved strangely, rubbing his eyes and saying to the other, ‘Comrade, what is this? These are not my eyes, I can’t see anything, guide me so I don’t fall.’ They struggled on with difficulty until evening, when they came to another inn. They entered the innkeeper’s room together, where a rich man was sitting at the table, counting money. The one with the thief’s hand went around him, twitched his arm a few times, and finally, when the rich man turned around, he reached into the pile of money and took a handful of it. The other one saw it and said, ‘Comrade, what are you doing? You can’t steal, be ashamed!’ ‘Ah,’ he said, ‘what can I do? My hand is twitching, I have to grab it, whether I want to or not.’ They went to sleep, and when they were lying there, it was so dark that you couldn’t see your hand in front of your face. Suddenly, the one with the cat’s eyes woke up, woke the others, and said, ‘Brothers, look, do you see the white mice running around?’ The other two sat up, but couldn’t see anything. Then he said, ‘It’s not right with us, we haven’t got our things back, we have to go back to the innkeeper, he has cheated us.’ So they set off the next morning and told the innkeeper that they hadn’t got their proper work back, the one had a thief’s hand, the second had cat’s eyes, and the third had a pig’s heart. The innkeeper said it must be the girl’s fault and wanted to call her, but when the three had seen her run out the back door, she didn’t come back. Then the three said, ‘He should give us a lot of money, or we’ll let the red rooster fly over his house.’ The innkeeper gave him what he had and could scrape together, and the three left with it. It was enough for their lives, but they would have preferred to have their proper work back.
