In the East Indies, the enemy was besieging the city and would not leave it, and would have the first six hundred inhabitants as prisoners. They blew their trumpets, and whoever could make them would be the Burgomaster. There was a poor fisherman who fished on the sea with his son, when the enemy came and took the son prisoner and gave him six hundred florins in exchange. The father then went to the lord in the city and gave him the money, and the enemy departed, and the fisherman became Burgomaster. Then it was proclaimed that anyone who was not called “Lord Burgomaster” would be hanged.

The son who was taken prisoner by the enemy was let out of the hands of the enemy and came to a great forest on a high mountain. The mountain that he climbed up, he came to a great, cursed castle, where there were stalls, disks, and benches all covered in cobwebs. There were three princesses, who were completely blackened, with a little white in their faces, who said to him that he should not be afraid, that they would do him no harm, that he could be freed. He said that he would gladly do so, but he did not know where he should do it. They said that he should not speak a word for a whole year, and should not look at them, but should tell them what he wanted, and they would do it when they gave him an answer. As he was there for a long time, he said that he wanted to go back to his father, and they said that he could do so, but he had to take this purse with money with him, and these clothes, and he had to return in eight days.

He was taken up again, and was immediately in the East Indies.

Then he could not find his father in the fishing hut, and asked the people where the poor fisherman had gone, and they said that he should not say it, or he would be hanged. Then he came to his father, and said “Fisher, where have you come from?” and the father said “You must not say it, when the lords of the city know it, you will be hanged.” But he would not be let go, and he was taken to the gallows. As he was there, he said “Oh, my lords, grant me the favor to go back to the old fishing hut.” Then he put on his old sail, and came back to the lords, and said “See, I am not an ordinary fisherman’s son, I have won the bride for my father and mother in this duel.” Then they recognized him and took pity on him, and took him back to his house, and he told them everything that had happened to him, that he had come to a forest on a high mountain, where he had climbed up, and had come to a cursed castle, where everything was covered in cobwebs, and three princesses had come to him, who were completely blackened, with a little white in their faces. They had told him that he should not be afraid, that he could be freed. Then his mother said that it might not be good to do so, he should take a consecrated water jug and drink glowing water in his face.

He went back again, and grumbled at them so that they fell asleep, and he dripped water in their faces, so that they became half white. Then all three princesses sprang up and said “The cursed dog, our blood will forever cry out for revenge, now a human being is born and will be born, who can free him, as he has defeated three brothers, who are in seven chains locked up, who will be tormented.” Then there was a loud cry in the whole castle, and he sprang out of the window and broke his leg, and the castle sank back into the ground, the mountain was again as it was, and nobody knew where it was. Then he was taken up again in the East Indies and became Burgomaster, and the enemy was hanged.
