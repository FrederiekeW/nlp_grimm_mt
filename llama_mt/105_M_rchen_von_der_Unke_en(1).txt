Es war einmal ein kleines Kind, dem gab seine Mutter jeden Nachmittag ein Schüsselchen mit Milch und Weckbrocken, und das Kind setzte sich damit hinaus in den Hof. Wenn es aber anfieng zu essen, so kam die Hausunke aus einer Mauerritze hervor gekrochen, senkte ihr Köpfchen in die Milch und aß mit. Das Kind hatte seine Freude daran, und wenn es mit seinem Schüsselchen da saß, und die Unke kam nicht gleich herbei, so rief es ihr zu

‘Unke, Unke, komm geschwind,
komm herbei, du kleines Ding,
sollst dein Bröckchen haben,
an der Milch dich laben.’

Da kam die Unke gelaufen und ließ es sich gut schmecken. Sie zeigte sich auch dankbar, denn sie brachte dem Kind aus ihrem heimlichen Schatz allerlei schöne Dinge, glänzende Steine, Perlen und goldene Spielsachen. Die Unke trank aber nur Milch und ließ die Brocken liegen. Da nahm das Kind einmal sein Löffelchen, schlug ihr damit sanft auf den Kopf und sagte ‘Ding, iß auch Brocken.’ Die Mutter, die in der Küche stand, hörte daß das Kind mit jemand sprach, und als sie sah daß es mit seinem Löffelchen nach einer Unke schlug, so lief sie mit einem Scheit Holz heraus und tödtete das gute Thier.

Von der Zeit an gieng eine Veränderung mit dem Kinde vor. Es war, so lange die Unke mit ihm gegessen hatte, groß und


stark geworden, jetzt aber verlor es seine schönen rothen Backen und magerte ab. Nicht lange, so fieng in der Nacht der Todtenvogel an zu schreien, und das Rothkelchen sammelte Zweiglein und Blätter zu einem Todtenkranz, und bald hernach lag das Kind auf der Bahre.

Ein Waisenkind saß an der Stadtmauer und spann, da sah es eine Unke aus einer Öffnung unten an der Mauer hervor kommen. Geschwind breitete es sein blau seidenes Halstuch neben sich aus, das die Unken gewaltig lieben und auf das sie allein gehen. Alsobald die Unke das erblickte, kehrte sie um, kam wieder und brachte ein kleines goldenes Krönchen getragen, legte es darauf und gieng dann wieder fort. Das Mädchen nahm die Krone auf, sie glitzerte und war von zartem Goldgespinnst. Nicht lange, so kam die Unke zum zweitenmal wieder: wie sie aber die Krone nicht mehr sah, kroch sie an die Wand und schlug vor Leid ihr Köpfchen so lange dawider, als sie nur noch Kräfte hatte, bis sie endlich todt da lag. Hätte das Mädchen die Krone liegen lassen, die Unke hätte wohl noch mehr von ihren Schätzen aus der Höhle herbeigetragen.

Unke ruft ‘huhu, huhu,’ Kind spricht ‘komm herut.’ Die Unke kommt hervor, da fragt das Kind nach seinem Schwesterchen ‘hast du Rothstrümpfchen nicht gesehen?’ Unke sagt ‘ne, ik og nit: wie du denn? huhu, huhu, huhu.’ Das Kind sagt ‘i weiß nicht, aber ich bin froh, dich zu sehen.’ Die Unke fragt nochmahl, ‘hast du Rothstrümpfchen nicht gesehen?’ Das Kind sagt nochmahl ‘ne, ik og nit, aber ich bin froh, dich zu sehen.’ Die Unke geht wieder hinein, und bald hernach hört man das Kind weinen, weil es nicht mehr sehen kann. Die Unke kommt wieder heraus, und das Kind fragt nach seinem Schwesterchen nochmahl, und die Unke sagt nochmahl ‘ne, ik og nit.’ Das Kind weint nochmahl, und die Unke kommt wieder heraus, und das Kind fragt nochmahl, und die Unke sagt nochmahl ‘ne, ik og nit, und geht dann wieder hinein, und das Kind weint, weil es nicht mehr sehen kann. Das Kind ist bald tot.

Ein kleines Kind, das in einem kleinen Zimmer saß, hatte einen kleinen Hund, der an der Wand lehnte und schlief. Das Kind sah die Unke aus einer Ritze hervorkommen, und die Unke sah den Hund, und die Unke ging langsam an den Hund herbei und betrachtete ihn. Das Kind sah das und sagte ‘Unke, Unke, komm herbei, ich will dir ein Stückchen geben.’ Die Unke kam langsam herbei, und das Kind gab ihr ein Stückchen Brot, und die Unke aß es und betrachtete den Hund nochmahl. Das Kind sah das und sagte ‘Unke, Unke, komm herbei, ich will dir ein Stückchen geben.’ Die Unke kam langsam herbei, und das Kind gab ihr ein Stückchen Brot, und die Unke aß es und betrachtete den Hund nochmahl. Das Kind sah das und sagte ‘Unke, Unke, komm herbei, ich will dir ein Stückchen geben.’ Die Unke kam langsam herbei, und das Kind gab ihr ein Stückchen Brot, und die Unke aß es und betrachtete den Hund nochmahl.
