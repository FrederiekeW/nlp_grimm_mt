A brother and a sister were playing by a well, and as they played, they both tumbled in. Down below, a water-nixie was waiting for them, and said, “Now I have you, now you shall work for me and be good.” She took them with her. She gave the girl a tangle of coarse, twisted flax to spin, and she had to haul water into a hollow cask. The boy, on the other hand, had to chop down a tree with a dull axe. And they had nothing to eat but hard, stone-like dumplings. At last, the children became so impatient that they waited until Sunday, when the nixie was in church, and then they made a run for it. As soon as the church was out of sight, the nixie saw that the birds had flown away, and she set off after them with great bounds. But the children saw her from a distance, and the girl threw a brush behind her, which created a great brush-heap with thousands and thousands of thorns. The nixie had to climb over this with great difficulty, but finally she made it. When the children saw this, the boy threw a comb behind him, which created a great comb-heap with tens of thousands of tines. But the nixie knew how to hold on and eventually made it over. Then the girl threw a mirror behind her, which created a great mirror-heap that was as smooth as glass. The nixie was unable to climb over this and thought to herself, “I'll quickly go back home and get my axe, and I'll chop this mirror-heap in two.” But by the time she got back and chopped the glass, the children were long gone, and the water-nixie had to return to her well.
