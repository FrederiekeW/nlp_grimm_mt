Once upon a time, there was a poor woman who gave birth to a boy, and because he had a lucky birthmark, it was prophesied that he would marry the king's daughter in his fourteenth year. It happened that the king soon came to the village, and no one knew that it was the king, and when he asked the people what was new, they replied, 'There has been a child born with a lucky birthmark: whatever such a child undertakes, it will turn out to his good fortune. It has also been foretold that in his fourteenth year, he shall marry the king's daughter.' The king, who had a wicked heart and was angry about the prophecy, went to the parents, acted very friendly and said, 'You poor people, leave me your child, I will take care of it.' At first, they refused, but when the stranger offered them heavy gold for it, and they thought, 'It's a lucky child, it must turn out to its good fortune,' they finally agreed and handed it over to him.

The king put it in a box and rode off with it until he came to a deep body of water, where he threw the box in and thought, 'I have helped my daughter by getting rid of this unexpected suitor.' But the box did not sink, but swam like a little boat, and not a single drop of water got in. It swam on for two miles from the king's capital, where there was a mill, and it got stuck in the weir. A miller's apprentice, who happened to be there and saw it, pulled it out with a hook and thought, 'I must have found great treasures,' but when he opened it, there was a beautiful boy inside, who was quite fresh and lively. He took him to the miller's family, and because they had no children, they were delighted and said, 'God has given it to us.' They took care of the foundling well, and he grew up in all virtues.

It happened that the king once came to the mill during a storm and asked the millers if the big boy was their son. 'No,' they replied, 'he is a foundling, he was born fourteen years ago in a box at the weir, and the miller's apprentice pulled him out of the water.' Then the king realized that it was none other than the lucky child he had thrown into the water, and said, 'Good people, could the boy not write a letter to the queen, I will give him two gold coins as a reward?' 'As the king commands,' replied the people, and told the boy to get ready. Then the king wrote a letter to the queen, in which it said, 'As soon as the boy arrives with this letter, he shall be killed and buried, and all shall be done before I return.'

The boy set out with the letter, but got lost and arrived in the evening in a great forest. In the darkness, he saw a small light, went towards it, and came to a little house. When he entered, an old woman was sitting by the fire alone. She was startled when she saw the boy and said, 'Where are you from and where are you going?' 'I come from the mill,' replied the boy, 'and want to go to the queen, as I have a letter to bring to her: but I got lost in the forest, so I wanted to spend the night here.' 'You poor boy,' said the old woman, 'you have come to a robber's den, and if they come home, they will kill you.' 'Let them come,' said the boy, 'I'm not afraid: I'm just so tired that I can't go any further,' he stretched out on a bench and fell asleep. Shortly afterwards, the robbers came and asked angrily what a strange boy was lying there. 'Ah,' said the old woman, 'it's an innocent child, it got lost in the forest, and I took it in out of charity: it has a letter to bring to the queen.' The robbers tore open the letter and read it, and it said that the boy should be killed as soon as he arrived. Then the hard-hearted robbers felt pity, and the leader tore up the letter and wrote another one, and it said that as soon as the boy arrived, he should be married to the king's daughter. They left him alone until the next morning, and when he woke up, they gave him the letter and showed him the way. The queen, when she received the letter and read it, did as it said, and ordered a grand wedding to be held, and the king's daughter was married to the lucky child; and since the boy was handsome and kind, she lived happily and contentedly with him.

After some time, the king came back to his castle and saw that the prophecy had been fulfilled and the lucky child was married to his daughter. 'How did this happen?' he said, 'I had written a completely different order in my letter.' Then the queen handed him the letter and said, 'You should see for yourself what's in it.' The king read the letter and realized that he had been given a different one. He asked the boy how the letter he had been entrusted with had ended up, and why he had brought another one instead. 'I don't know,' replied the boy, 'it must have been exchanged for me while I was sleeping in the forest.' Enraged, the king said, 'You'll get away with this easily, whoever wants my daughter must get me three golden hairs from the devil's head; bring me what I demand, and you can keep my daughter.' The king hoped to get rid of him forever. The lucky child replied, 'I'll get the golden hairs, I'm not afraid of the devil.' With that, he took his leave and began his journey.

The way led him to a large city, where the gatekeeper asked him what trade he understood and what he knew. 'I know everything,' replied the lucky child. 'So you can do me a favor,' said the gatekeeper, 'if you tell me why our market well, which used to flow with wine, has dried up and no longer gives water.' 'You'll find out,' replied the boy, 'wait until I come back.' He went on and came to another city, where the gatekeeper again asked him what trade he understood and what he knew. 'I know everything,' replied the boy. 'So you can do me a favor,' said the gatekeeper, 'and tell me why a tree in our city, which used to bear golden apples, now no longer produces leaves.' 'You'll find out,' replied the boy, 'wait until I come back.' He went on and came to a large body of water, where he had to cross over. The ferryman asked him what trade he understood and what he knew. 'I know everything,' replied the boy. 'So you can do me a favor,' said the ferryman, 'and tell me why I always have to ferry back and forth and never get relieved.' 'You'll find out,' replied the boy, 'wait until I come back.'

When he had crossed the water, he found the entrance to hell. It was dark and smoky inside, and the devil was not at home, but his grandmother was sitting in a broad armchair. 'What do you want?' she said to him, looked at him, but did not seem as wicked as one might expect. 'I want to get three golden hairs from the devil's head,' replied the boy, 'otherwise I won't be able to keep my wife.' 'That's a lot to ask,' she said, 'if the devil comes home and finds you, you're a goner; but you've been kind to me, I'll see if I can help you.' She transformed him into an ant and said, 'Crawl into my skirt folds, you'll be safe there.' 'Yes,' replied the boy, 'that's fine, but I'd like to know three things: why a well, which used to flow with wine, has dried up and no longer gives water, why a tree, which used to bear golden apples, no longer produces leaves, and why a ferryman always has to ferry back and forth and never gets relieved?' 'Those are difficult questions,' she replied, 'but stay calm and quiet, and pay attention to what the devil says when I take the three golden hairs out of his head.'

When evening fell, the devil came home. As soon as he entered, he noticed that the air was not clean. 'I smell human flesh,' he said,'something's not right here.' Then he looked around and searched, but couldn't find anything. The grandmother scolded him, 'Just now the place has been cleaned,' she said, 'and everything is in order, now you're throwing it all to pieces again; you're always smelling human flesh!' She calmed him down and said, 'Sit down and eat your dinner.' When he had eaten and drunk, he was tired, laid his head in the grandmother's lap, and said she should scratch his head. It didn't take long before he fell asleep and began to snore. Then the grandmother took a golden hair, pulled it out, and laid it beside her. 'Ouch!' the devil shouted, 'what are you doing?' 'I had a bad dream,' replied the grandmother, 'and I grabbed your hair.' 'What did you dream about?' asked the devil. 'I dreamed that a well, which used to flow with wine, had dried up and no longer gave water,' she said. 'Ha! if they knew!' replied the devil, 'there's a frog under a stone in the well, if you kill it, the wine will flow again.' The grandmother scratched his head again until he fell asleep and began to snore, then she pulled out the second golden hair. 'Hu! what are you doing?' shouted the devil angrily. 'Don't take it badly,' replied the grandmother, 'I did it in my dream.' 'What did you dream about this time?' asked the devil. 'I dreamed that a tree, which used to bear golden apples, no longer produced leaves,' she said. 'Ha! if they knew!' replied the devil, 'there's a mouse gnawing at the root of the tree, if you kill it, the tree will produce golden apples again; but if you let it gnaw longer, the tree will wither completely.' The grandmother scratched his head again until he fell asleep and began to snore, then she pulled out the third golden hair. The devil sprang up, shouted, and wanted to be angry with her, but she calmed him down again and said, 'Who can be blamed for bad dreams?' 'What did you dream about?' asked the devil, and was curious. 'I dreamed about a ferryman who complained that he had to ferry back and forth and never got relieved,' she said. 'Ha! the fool!' replied the devil, 'if someone comes and wants to be ferried over, you should give him the oar, then the other one will ferry and you'll be free.' When the grandmother had pulled out the three golden hairs and answered the three questions, she left the devil alone, and he fell asleep until the next day.

When the devil had left, the grandmother took the ant out of her skirt folds and gave the lucky child back his human form. 'Here are the three golden hairs,' she said, 'you should have heard what the devil said to your three questions, and you should remember it well.' 'Yes,' replied the boy, 'I heard it and will remember it.' 'So you've been helped,' said the grandmother, 'and now you can go your way.' He thanked the old woman for her help in his time of need, left the underworld, and was happy that everything had turned out well for him.

When he came to the ferryman, he should give him the promised answer. 'Ferry me over first,' said the lucky child, 'then I'll tell you how you can be relieved.' When he had crossed the water, he gave the ferryman the devil's advice, 'When someone comes and wants to be ferried over, give him the oar, then the other one will ferry and you'll be free.' He went on and came to the city where the barren tree stood, and where the gatekeeper also wanted to know the answer. He told him what the devil had said, 'Kill the mouse that's gnawing at the root of the tree, then it will produce golden apples again.' The gatekeeper thanked him and gave him two mules loaded with gold as a reward, which had to follow him. Finally, he came to the city whose well had dried up, and he told the gatekeeper what the devil had said, 'There's a frog under a stone in the well, you must kill it, then the well will give wine again.' The gatekeeper thanked him and gave him two mules loaded with gold.

In the end, the lucky child arrived home with his wife, who was overjoyed to see him again and hear how well everything had turned out for him. He brought the king what he had demanded, the three golden hairs of the devil, and when the king saw the four mules loaded with gold, he was delighted and said, 'Now all the conditions have been fulfilled, and you can keep my daughter.' But, dear son-in-law, tell me where all this gold comes from, these are enormous treasures!' 'I went over a river,' replied the boy, 'and took it with me, it lies there instead of sand on the riverbank.' 'Can I get some of it too?' asked the king, who was eager. 'As much as you want,' replied the boy, 'there's a ferryman on the river, let him ferry you over, then you can fill your sacks with it.' The greedy king hurried off to the river and, when he arrived, he waved to the ferryman, who should ferry him over. The ferryman came and told him to get in, and when they reached the other side of the river, he gave him the oar and jumped off. The king had to ferry back and forth as punishment for his sins.

'Will he ever stop?' 'What do you mean? No one will take the oar away from him.' Then the king realized what the devil had told him, and he had to ferry until he was tired, and when he finally came ashore, he had to turn back and ferry again, until he was finally exhausted. He saw the sacks of gold on the riverbank and thought, 'I'm so close, but I can't get it.' He ferried back and forth until he was finally exhausted, and when he came ashore, he went to the mules loaded with gold and shouted, 'Oh, poor mules, you can't talk!' 'No,' replied the mules, 'we can't talk, but we can tell you why you can't talk.' 'Why?' asked the king. 'Because you always think only of yourself,' replied the mules. 'That's true,' said the king, and looked at himself, and then he realized what he had done, and felt ashamed. He went to the ferryman and said, 'Ferry me back over, I'm tired and want to go home.' 'That's fine,' replied the ferryman, 'but tell me, what did you see on your way, and how did you feel?' The king told him everything that had happened to him, and when he finished, the ferryman said, 'Well, now you've learned, and I'll help you, and ferry you back over.' The king thanked him and got into the ferry, and when he had crossed the water, he went to the king and said, 'Now you can get your gold, and I'll tell you why the well has dried up, the tree doesn't bloom, and the ferryman isn't relieved.' 'That's fine,' replied the king, and listened to the lucky child's explanation, 'there's a frog in the well, you must kill it, there's a mouse gnawing at the root of the tree, you must kill it, and if someone comes and wants to be ferried over, give him the oar, then the other one will ferry and you'll be free.' The king thanked the lucky child, and asked him to tell his wife to come, and the royal family lived happily and contentedly from then on.
