In times long past, when the dear God himself walked on earth among men, it happened that he was tired one evening and night overtook him before he could reach an inn. Now there stood on the road before him two houses facing each other, one large and beautiful, the other small and poor-looking, and the large one belonged to a rich man, the small one to a poor man. Then our Lord God thought, "The rich man will not be bothered by me: I will spend the night at his house." The rich man, when he heard someone knocking at his door, opened the window and asked the traveler what he was looking for. The Lord replied, "I ask for a night's lodging." The rich man looked the traveler from head to foot, and because the dear God wore simple clothes and did not look like someone with a lot of money in his pocket, he shook his head and said, "I cannot take you in, my chambers are full of herbs and seeds, and if I were to take in every stranger who knocks on my door, I would have to take up the beggar's staff myself. Find another place to stay." He slammed the window shut and left the dear God standing there. So the dear God turned his back on him and went over to the small house. As soon as he knocked, the poor man opened the door and invited the traveler to enter. "Stay the night with me," he said. "It is dark, and you cannot go any further today." This pleased the dear God, and he entered.

The poor man's wife offered him her hand, welcomed him warmly, and said, "Make yourself comfortable, and take what you like, we don't have much, but we'll give you what we have." Then she set potatoes on the fire, and while they were cooking, she milked their goat to have some milk to go with them. And when the table was set, the dear God sat down and ate with them, and he enjoyed the poor food, because there were happy faces around the table. After they had eaten, and it was time for bed, the woman whispered to her husband, "Listen, dear husband, we'll make a bed of straw for the poor traveler, so he can rest in our bed: he's been walking all day, he must be tired." "I'd be happy to do it," replied the man. "I'll offer it to him." He went to the dear God and invited him to lie down in their bed and rest his limbs properly. The dear God did not want to take the old couple's bed, but they would not give up, until he finally did and lay down in their bed: they themselves made a bed of straw on the floor. The next morning, they were already up early and cooked a breakfast for their guest, as good as they could. When the sun shone through the window and the dear God got up, he ate with them again and wanted to continue on his way. As he stood in the door, he turned around and said, "Because you are so kind and pious, I will grant you three wishes, and I will fulfill them." The poor man replied, "What else can I wish for but eternal salvation, and that we two, as long as we live, remain healthy and have our daily bread; for the third, I don't know what to wish for." The dear God said, "Would you not like to wish for a new house instead of the old one?" "Oh yes," said the man, "if I could still get it, it would be nice." The dear God granted their wishes, transformed their old house into a new one, gave them his blessing, and continued on his way.

It was already full daylight when the rich man got up. He looked out the window and saw a new, clean house with red tiles where the old hut had stood. He was amazed, called his wife over, and said, "Tell me, what has happened? Yesterday evening, the old hut was still standing, and today there is a beautiful new house. Go over there and find out how it happened." The wife went over and asked the poor man, who told her, "Yesterday evening, a traveler came looking for a night's lodging, and this morning, when he said goodbye, he granted us three wishes: eternal salvation, health in this life, and the daily bread that we need, and finally, a new house instead of the old one." The rich man's wife ran back and told her husband what had happened. The man said, "I would tear myself apart and shatter myself: if only I had known! The stranger was here first and wanted to spend the night with us, but I turned him away." "Hurry," said the wife, "and get on your horse, you can still catch the man and ask him to grant you three wishes too." The rich man followed the wife's advice, rode off on his horse, and caught up with the dear God. He spoke nicely and politely and asked him not to take it badly that he had not been let in immediately, that he had looked for the key to the front door, and that he would come back and visit him. "Yes," said the dear God, "if I come back, I will do it." The rich man asked if he could not also make three wishes, just like his neighbor. "Yes," said the dear God, "you can, but it would not be good for you, and you should not wish for anything." The rich man said, "I will choose something that will bring me good fortune, if only I knew that it would be fulfilled." The dear God said, "Ride home and make three wishes, and they will be fulfilled."

The rich man had what he wanted, rode home, and began to think about what he should wish for. As he thought and let the reins go, the horse started to jump, so that he was constantly distracted and could not put his thoughts together. He patted the horse on the neck and said, "Be quiet, Liese," but the horse started to jump again. Finally, he got angry and shouted, "I want you to break your neck!" As soon as he said that, he fell to the ground, and the horse was dead and did not move anymore; that was the first wish fulfilled. Because he was naturally stingy, he did not want to leave the saddle behind, cut it off, hung it on his back, and had to walk on foot. "I still have two wishes left," he thought and comforted himself with that. As he walked slowly through the sand and the sun beat down on him at noon, he became hot and irritable. The saddle was pressing on his back, and he still had not thought of what he should wish for. "If I could wish for all the riches and treasures in the world," he said to himself, "I would still think of something else later on: I will arrange it so that I have nothing left to wish for." Then he sighed and said, "Yes, if I were the Bavarian farmer who also had three wishes, he knew how to help himself, he wished for a lot of beer, and secondly, as much beer as he could drink, and thirdly, a barrel of beer." Sometimes he thought he had found it, but then it seemed to him to be too little. Then something occurred to him that would have been good for his wife, who was sitting at home in a cool room and enjoying herself. That annoyed him, and without thinking, he said, "I wish that my wife were sitting at home on the saddle, and could not get off it, instead of me carrying it on my back." And as soon as the last word left his mouth, the saddle was gone from his back, and he realized that his second wish had also been fulfilled. Then he became even hotter, he started to run and wanted to sit alone in his room and think about something big for his third wish. When he arrived and opened the door, his wife was sitting in the middle of the room on the saddle and could not get off it, crying and screaming. He said, "Be satisfied, I will grant you all the riches of the world, but stay on the saddle." She scolded him, saying, "What good are all the riches of the world to me if I'm stuck on the saddle? You've put me on it, you have to get me off it." He could not avoid it, he had to fulfill the third wish, that she could get off the saddle, and it was fulfilled immediately. So he had nothing but trouble, hardship, and scolding words, and a lost horse: the poor couple, on the other hand, lived happily, quietly, and piously until their blessed end.
