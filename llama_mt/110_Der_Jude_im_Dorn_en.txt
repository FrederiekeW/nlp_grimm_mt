The once rich man had a servant who worked diligently and honestly for him. Every morning the servant was the first to get out of bed and every evening the last to go back to bed. When there was a difficult task that no one wanted to do, he always volunteered to do it. He never complained, but was always content and cheerful. When the year was up, the master gave him no pay and thought, "This is the most sensible thing, I will save some money and he will not leave me, but stay nicely in service." The servant was silent and did not speak out, did the second year as the first year, and when he received no pay at the end of it, he let it be and stayed longer. When the third year came around, the master thought, "I will reach into my pocket and take out some money," but he found nothing. Then the servant finally spoke up and said, "Sir, I have served you faithfully for three years, be so kind and give me what is rightfully mine: I want to leave and look around the world." The master replied, "Yes, my dear servant, you have served me unswervingly, and for that you will be rewarded mildly," and reached into his pocket, but only pulled out three pennies, "Here, take one penny for each year, that's a big and generous reward, like you would get from few masters." The good servant, who did not understand much about money, thought, "Now you have enough in your pocket, why bother and strain yourself with hard work any longer?" And he left, going up and down hills, singing and jumping with joy.

As he was walking, he came across a bush and a small man came out of it and called out, "Where are you off to, Brother Joy? I see you're not burdened by your worries." "What's there to be sad about?" replied the servant, "I have enough, the pay for three years is ringing in my pocket." "How much is your treasure?" asked the little man. "How much? Three whole pennies, counted correctly." "Listen," said the dwarf, "I'm a poor, needy man, give me your three pennies: I can't work anymore, but you're young and can easily earn your bread." And because the servant had a good heart and felt sorry for the little man, he handed over his three pennies and said, "In God's name, it won't hurt me." The little man said, "Since I see your good heart, I'll grant you three wishes, one for each penny, they will come true." "Ah," said the servant, "you're one who can make blue smoke. Well, if it's to be, I'll wish for a birdcall that hits everything I aim at: secondly, a fiddle that makes everything dance that hears its sound: and thirdly, if I ask someone for something, they must not refuse me." "You'll have all that," said the little man, reached into the bush, and, imagine it, there was the fiddle and the birdcall already ready, as if they had been ordered. He gave them to the servant and said, "Whatever you ask for, no one on earth will refuse you."

"What do you want now, heart?" said the servant to himself, and continued on his way with joy. Soon he came across a Jew with a long beard, who stood and listened to the song of a bird perched high up in a tree. "God's wonders!" he exclaimed, "such a small creature has such a mighty voice! If only it were mine! Who could put salt on its tail?" "If that's all," said the servant, "the bird will soon be down." He took aim and hit it right on the head, and the bird fell down into the thorn bushes. "Go, scoundrel," said the servant to the Jew, "and get the bird out." "Mine," said the Jew, "let the master leave the boy alone, a dog ran by; I'll pick up the bird because you hit it, and I'll take it." He lay down on the ground and started to work his way into the thorn bushes. As he was stuck in the middle of the thorns, the servant's good nature got the better of him, and he took out his fiddle and started to play. Immediately the Jew started to jump up and down, and the more the servant played, the better the Jew danced. But the thorns tore his tattered clothes, combed his beard, and pricked him all over. "Ah," cried the Jew, "what's the point of playing! Leave the playing, I don't want to dance!" But the servant didn't listen and thought, "You've hurt the people enough, now the thorn bushes won't do you any better." And he started to play again, and the Jew had to jump higher and higher, and the tatters of his clothes got stuck on the thorns. "Ah, woe is me!" cried the Jew, "I'll give the master anything he wants, if only he'll stop playing, a whole purse full of gold!" "If you're so generous," said the servant, "I'll stop playing, but you have to join in the dance, and do it with some style." He took the purse and continued on his way.

The Jew stood still and watched him go, and was quiet until the servant was far away and out of sight, then he cried out at the top of his lungs, "You wretched musician, you beer-fiddler, wait until I catch you alone! I'll chase you, so you lose your shoe soles: you scoundrel, put a groschen in your mouth, so you're worth six Heller!" And he continued to curse and abuse him. And when he had blown off some steam, he ran to the judge in the city. "Judge, oh dear! Look how a godless man has robbed and mistreated me on the open road: a stone on the ground would pity me: torn clothes! a body torn and scratched! my little poverty, along with the purse, taken from me! All Dukats, one more beautiful than the other: for God's sake, have the man thrown into prison!" Said the judge, "Was it a soldier who robbed you with his saber?" "God forbid!" said the Jew, "he didn't have a naked sword, but a pipe on his back and a fiddle on his neck; the scoundrel is easily recognizable." The judge sent his men after him, and they found the good servant, who was walking slowly, and they also found the purse with gold. When he was brought before the judge, he said, "I haven't touched the Jew or taken his money, he offered it to me himself, so that I would stop playing, because he couldn't stand my music." "God forbid!" cried the Jew, "he's lying like a fly on the wall." But the judge didn't believe it and said, "That's a bad excuse, that's not how Jews behave." And he sentenced the good servant to be hanged, because he had committed a robbery on the open road. As he was being led away, the Jew shouted, "You bear-haunter, you dog-musician, now you'll get your well-deserved reward!" The servant climbed up the gallows with the executioner, but on the last rung, he turned around and said to the judge, "Grant me one last request, before I die." "Yes," said the judge, "if you don't ask for your life." "Not for my life," replied the servant, "I ask you to let me play my fiddle one last time." The Jew cried out, "For God's sake, don't let him! Don't let him!" But the judge said, "Why should I deny him this small pleasure? It's been granted to him, and that's the end of it." The Jew cried out, "Ah, woe is me! Bind me tight, bind me fast!" The servant took out his fiddle, tuned it, and as soon as he played the first note, everything began to sway and wobble, the judge, the clerks, and the court officials: and the rope fell out of the hand of the man who was trying to bind the Jew. At the second note, they all lifted their legs, and the executioner let the servant go and started to dance. At the third note, they all sprang up and started to dance, and the judge and the Jew were in the front and danced the best. Soon everyone who had come to the market out of curiosity was dancing, old and young, fat and thin, men and women together: even the dogs that had followed were sitting on their hind legs and hopping. And the longer he played, the higher they jumped, until they collided with each other and started to wail. Finally, the judge, out of breath, said, "I'll give you your life, just stop playing!" The servant was moved and stopped playing, hung his fiddle around his neck again, and climbed down the gallows. Then he went to the Jew, who was lying on the ground, panting for breath, and said, "Scoundrel, now confess where you got the money, or I'll take my fiddle out and start playing again." "I stole it," he cried, "I stole it, you've earned it honestly." The judge then had the Jew taken to the gallows and hanged as a thief. The servant, however, went home, got into bed, and said, "Now my life is as pleasant as it can be."
