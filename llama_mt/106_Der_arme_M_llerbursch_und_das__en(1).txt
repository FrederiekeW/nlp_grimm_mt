In a mill lived an old miller who had no wife or children, and three miller boys served him. After they had been with him for several years, he said to them one day, "I am old, and I want to sit behind the oven: you leave, and whoever brings me the best horse home, I will give the mill to him, and he shall take care of me until my death." The third of the boys, however, was the little one, who was considered foolish by the others, and they did not want to give him the mill; and he did not want it either. So all three left together, and as they came to the village, the two said to the foolish Hans, "You can only stay here, you'll get a horse for your whole life." But Hans went with them anyway, and when it was night, they came to a cave, where they lay down to sleep. The two clever ones waited until Hans had fallen asleep, then they got up, left, and left Hans lying there, and thought they had done something clever; yes, it will not go well for you! When the sun rose, and Hans woke up, he lay in a deep cave: he looked around and cried, "Oh God, where am I!" Then he got up and crawled out of the cave, went into the forest, and thought, "I am here all alone and abandoned, how will I get a horse now!" Just as he was lost in thought, he met a small, colorful cat, who spoke very kindly, "Hans, where are you going?" "Oh, you can't help me." "What you want, I know well," said the cat, "you want a beautiful horse. Come with me, and be my faithful servant for seven years, and I will give you one, more beautiful than you have ever seen in your life." "Now that's a strange cat," thought Hans, "but I'll see if she's telling the truth." So she took him to her cursed castle, where there were many cats that served her: they sprang quickly up and down the stairs, were lively and in good spirits. In the evening, when they sat down to eat, three had to make music: one played the bass, the other the violin, the third blew the trumpet and blew his cheeks so hard as he could. After they had eaten, the table was taken away, and the cat said, "Now, Hans, come and dance with me." "No," replied he, "I won't dance with a cat, I've never done that before." "So bring him to bed," said she to the cats. Then one of them lit up his bedroom, one took off his shoes, one his stockings, and finally one blew out the light. The next morning they came again and helped him out of bed: one put on his stockings, one tied his garters, one brought his shoes, one washed him, and one dried his face with its tail. "That's done very gently," said Hans. He had to serve the cat too and chop wood every day; he got a silver axe, and the mallet and saw were of silver, and the chopper was of copper. Now, he chopped wood, stayed in the house, had good food and drink, but saw no one but the colorful cat and her servants. One day she said to him, "Go and mow my meadow, and dry the grass." And she gave him a silver sickle and a gold whetstone, but also told him to do everything properly. So Hans went and did what he was told, and after he had finished the work, he brought the sickle, whetstone, and hay back to the house, and asked if she would give him his reward yet. "No," said the cat, "you must still do something else for me: there is silver building material, a silver joiner's axe, a silver joiner's iron, and what else is needed, all of silver, and I want you to build a small house for me." So Hans built the house finished and said he had done everything, and had not yet got a horse. But the seven years had passed like half a year. The cat asked him if he wanted to see her horses. "Yes," said Hans. So she opened the house door, and because she opens the door like that, twelve horses stand there, oh, they were proud, they had blazed and shone, and his heart was filled with joy. Now she gave him food and drink, and said, "Go home, I won't give you the horse: in three days, however, I'll bring it to you." So Hans went away, and she showed him the way to the mill. But she had not even given him a new dress, but he had to keep his old, tattered smock that he had brought with him, which had become too short for him everywhere in the seven years. When he came home, the two other miller boys were also back: each had brought his horse, but one of them was blind, the other lame. They asked, "Hans, where is your horse?" "In three days, it will come." Then they laughed and said, "Ah, Hans, where will you get a horse from, that will be something!" Hans went into the room, but the miller said he shouldn't come to the table, he was so torn and ragged, one would be ashamed if someone came in. So they gave him some food outside, and when they went to sleep in the evening, the two others did not want to give him a bed, and he had to crawl into the goose coop and lie on some hard straw. The next morning, when he woke up, the three days had passed, and a carriage with six horses came, oh, they shone beautifully, and a servant brought another seventh, which was for the poor miller boy. From the carriage stepped a beautiful princess, and she went into the mill, and the princess was the small, colorful cat, whom the poor Hans had served for seven years. She asked the miller where the miller boy, the little one, was. The miller said, "We can't take him into the mill, he's so torn and ragged, he's in the goose coop." The princess said, "You should bring him right away." So they brought him out, and he had to pack his smock together to cover himself. Then the servant put on beautiful clothes, and washed and dressed him, and when he was finished, no king could look more beautiful. Then the princess asked to see the horses that the other miller boys had brought, one was blind, the other lame. Then she had the servant bring the seventh horse: when the miller saw it, he said, "That one has never come to my yard before!" "And that is for the third miller boy," said the princess. "Then he should have the mill," said the miller, but the princess said, "And he should keep the mill too: and takes her faithful Hans and sets him in the carriage and drives away with him." They first drove to the small house that he had built with the silver tools, and there it was a big castle, and everything in it was of silver and gold; and there she had married him, and was he rich, so rich that he had enough for the rest of his life. Therefore, no one should say that someone who is foolish cannot become something good.
