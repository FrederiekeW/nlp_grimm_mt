The hen spoke to the hen, ‘Now is the time when the nuts are ripe, let us go up the mountain together and eat our fill before the squirrel takes them all away.’ ‘Yes,’ replied the hen, ‘come, let us make ourselves happy together.’ So they went off together to the mountain, and since it was a bright day, they stayed until evening. I don’t know if they had eaten too much or if they had become too proud, but in any case, they didn’t want to walk home on foot and the hen had to build a small cart made of nutshells. When it was finished, the hen got in and said to the cock, ‘You can only pull, you can’t drive.’ ‘You’re right,’ said the cock, ‘I’d rather walk home than be harnessed: no, we didn’t wager on that. I want to be the coachman and sit on the box, but I won’t pull.’ As they were arguing, a goose came by and said, ‘You thieves, who told you to come into my nut forest? Wait, this will come back to haunt you!’ She came charging at the hen with her beak open. But the hen wasn’t lazy and stood up to the goose, and finally the hen kicked her so hard with its spurs that she begged for mercy and was happy to be punished by being harnessed to the cart. The hen got on the box and became the coachman, and they drove off in a hurry, ‘Goose, run as fast as you can!’ As they had been driving for a bit, they met two pedestrians, a sewing needle and a sewing needle. They cried out, ‘Stop! Stop!’ and said that it would soon be dark, and they wouldn’t be able to take another step, and the road would be too dirty, so could they not get in for a bit? They were in front of the inn and had been drinking beer and had lost track of time. The hen, since they were thin people who didn’t take up much space, let them in, but they had to promise not to tread on its feet. Late in the evening, they arrived at an inn, and since they didn’t want to drive any further, the goose was also not able to walk well and kept falling over, so they went in. The innkeeper at first made many objections, saying his house was full, and he thought they weren’t a noble clientele, but finally, since they spoke sweetly, he said they could stay the night. They ordered a new meal and lived it up. Early the next morning, when it was still dark and everyone was still asleep, the hen woke the cock, fetched the egg that the hen had laid on the way, picked it up, and they ate it together; they threw the shells on the fire. Then they went to the sewing needle, which was still asleep, grabbed it by the head, and stuck it in the innkeeper’s armchair cushion, and the sewing needle in his handkerchief, and finally they flew off, without a word. The goose, which liked to sleep outside and had stayed in the courtyard, heard them flying away, got up, and found a stream, which she swam down; and that went faster than driving in the cart. A few hours later, the innkeeper got up, washed himself, and wanted to dry himself with the handkerchief, but the sewing needle pricked him in the face and made a red streak from one ear to the other. Then he went into the kitchen, and wanted to light a pipe, but when he came to the fire, the eggshells jumped into his eyes. ‘Today, everything is against me,’ he said, and sat down grumpily on his grandfather’s chair. But he quickly jumped up again and shouted, ‘Ouch!’ because the sewing needle had pricked him even worse and not in the face. Now he was fully angry and suspected the guests who had arrived so late the previous evening; and when he went to look for them, they were gone. So he made a vow not to take in any more rascals in his house, who eat a lot, don’t pay, and then play tricks on him. And so he was left alone.
