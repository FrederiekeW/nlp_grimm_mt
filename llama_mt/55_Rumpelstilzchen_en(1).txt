Once upon a time there was a miller who was poor but had a beautiful daughter. It so happened that he met the king, and to make a good impression, he said to him, ‘I have a daughter who can spin straw into gold.’ The king said to the miller, ‘That is an art that I find pleasing, if your daughter is as skilled as you say, bring her to my castle tomorrow, and I will put her to the test.’ When the girl was brought to him, he led her into a room that was completely full of straw, gave her a distaff and spindle, and said, ‘Now, get to work, and if you do not spin this straw into gold by morning, you must die.’ Then he locked the room himself, and she was left alone in it.

There sat the poor miller’s daughter, not knowing what to do, for she did not understand how to spin straw into gold, and her fear grew greater and greater until she began to weep. Then the door opened, and a small man entered and said, ‘Good evening, miller’s daughter, why are you weeping so much?’ ‘Oh,’ she replied, ‘I am to spin straw into gold, but I do not understand it.’ The small man said, ‘What will you give me if I spin it for you?’ ‘My necklace,’ she said. The small man took the necklace, sat down at the distaff, and spun, spun, spun, three times, and the spindle was full. Then he put another one on, and spun, spun, spun, three times, and the second one was full as well. And so it went until morning, when all the straw was spun into gold, and all the spindles were full. When the king came in the morning and saw the gold, he was astonished and delighted, but his heart grew even greedier. He had the miller’s daughter brought into a larger room full of straw, and ordered her to spin it all into gold by night, if she wanted to live. The girl did not know what to do, and wept, but the small man appeared once again, and said, ‘What will you give me if I spin this straw into gold for you?’ ‘My ring from my finger,’ she replied. The small man took the ring, began to spin again with the distaff, and by morning had spun all the straw into gold. The king was overjoyed at the sight, but was still not satisfied with gold, and had the miller’s daughter brought into an even larger room full of straw, and said, ‘You must spin this too by night, and if you succeed, you will be my queen.’ ‘Even if it is a miller’s daughter,’ he thought, ‘I will not find a richer wife in all the world.’ When the girl was left alone, the small man came to her for the third time and said, ‘What will you give me if I spin this straw for you?’ ‘I have nothing left to give you,’ she replied. ‘Then promise me that if you become queen, you will give me your first child.’ ‘Who knows how this will turn out,’ thought the miller’s daughter, and did not know what to do in her distress, so she promised the small man what he wanted, and he spun the straw into gold once more. And when the king came in the morning and found everything as he had wished, he married her, and the beautiful miller’s daughter became a queen.

Over a year later, she gave birth to a beautiful child, and did not think about the small man again, but he suddenly appeared in her chamber and said, ‘Now give me what you promised me.’ The queen was frightened and offered the small man all the treasures of the kingdom if he would leave her child alone, but the small man said, ‘No, I prefer something living to all the treasures in the world.’ Then the queen began to lament and weep, and the small man took pity on her and said, ‘I will give you three days to find out my name, and if you can do that by then, you may keep your child.’ Now the queen thought about all the names she had ever heard during the night, and sent a messenger across the land to find out if there were any other names, and the next day the small man came and the queen began to say, ‘Caspar, Melchior, Balzer,’ and all the names she knew in order, but the small man said, ‘That is not my name.’ On the second day, she had people in the neighborhood ask how they were called, and then said to the small man all the strange and unusual names she could think of, ‘Do you perhaps call yourself Rippenbiest or Hammelswade or Schnürbein?’ but it replied each time, ‘That is not my name.’ On the third day, the messenger returned and told her, ‘I have found no new names, but as I climbed up a high mountain near the Waldecke, where the fox and the hare said goodnight to each other, I saw a small house, and a fire was burning in front of the house, and around the fire a man was jumping on one leg and shouting,

‘Today I bake, tomorrow I brew,
the day after tomorrow I’ll fetch the queen’s child;
ah, how good it is that no one knows
that I am called Rumpelstilzchen!’

You can imagine how happy the queen was when she heard the name, and when the small man came in soon after and asked, ‘Now, Queen, what is my name?’ she asked, ‘Do you call yourself Kunz?’ ‘No.’ ‘Do you call yourself Heinz?’ ‘No.’ ‘Do you perhaps call yourself Rumpelstilzchen?’ The small man shrieked, ‘The devil told you that, the devil told you that!’ and in his rage he kicked his right foot so deep into the ground that it went up to his waist, then he grabbed his left foot with both hands and tore himself in two. The small man was no longer visible.

The queen was overjoyed, as if her child had been returned to her, and hugged the child and said, ‘Now, my child, you are mine, and you shall never be separated from your father or mother again.’ And so it remained.
