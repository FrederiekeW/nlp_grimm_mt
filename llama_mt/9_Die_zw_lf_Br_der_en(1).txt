Once upon a time there was a king and a queen who lived in peace with one another and had twelve children, but all of them were boys. The king said to his wife, “If the thirteenth child you bear is a girl, then the twelve boys shall die, so that our wealth and kingdom may be mine alone.” He had twelve coffins made, which were already filled with sawdust, and each had a dead man’s kiss in it, and he had them placed in a locked room. He gave the queen the key and forbade her from telling anyone about it.

The queen sat all day and wept, so much so that the youngest son, who was always with her and whom she named Benjamin according to the Bible, asked her, “Dear mother, why are you so sad?” “Dearest child,” she replied, “I must not tell you.” But he wouldn’t leave her alone until she went and opened the room, and showed him the twelve coffins already filled with sawdust. Then she said, “My dearest Benjamin, the king has had these coffins made for you and your eleven brothers, for if I bear a girl, you and your brothers will all be killed and buried in them.” And as she wept while saying this, Benjamin comforted her and said, “Don’t cry, dear mother, we will help ourselves and leave.” She said, “Go with your eleven brothers into the forest, and each of you sit on the tallest tree you can find, and keep watch and look out for the tower in the castle. If I bear a boy, I will raise a white flag, and then you may return. If I bear a girl, I will raise a red flag, and then flee as quickly as you can, and may the dear God protect you.” For all night, I will rise and pray for you, in the winter that you may warm yourselves by a fire, and in the summer that you may not suffer from the heat.”

After she had blessed her sons, they went out into the forest. One of them kept watch over the others, sat on the tallest oak tree, and looked out for the tower. After eleven days, it was Benjamin’s turn, and he saw a flag being raised: but it was not the white flag, but the red flag, which announced that they were all to die. When the brothers heard this, they became angry and said, “Should we die for the sake of a girl? We swear that we will avenge ourselves: wherever we find a girl, her red blood will flow.”

Then they went deeper into the forest, and in the middle of it, where it was darkest, they came upon a small, cursed house that stood empty. They said, “Here we will live, and you, Benjamin, you are the youngest and weakest, you will stay here and manage the household, and we will go out and hunt.” So they went into the forest and shot rabbits, deer, birds, and what else was edible, and brought it back to Benjamin, who had to prepare it for them so that they could satisfy their hunger. They lived together in the house for ten years, and the time did not seem long to them.

The daughter that the queen had borne was now grown up, was good-hearted and beautiful, and had a golden star on her forehead. One day, when there was a big wash, she saw twelve men’s shirts under it and asked her mother, “Whose are these twelve shirts? They are too small for the king, aren’t they?” The queen replied with a heavy heart, “Dear child, they belong to your twelve brothers.” The girl said, “Where are my twelve brothers? I have never heard of them.” The queen replied, “God knows where they are: they are wandering in the world.” Then she took the girl and showed her the room, and the twelve coffins with sawdust and dead man’s kisses in them. “These coffins,” she said, “were intended for your brothers, but they secretly fled before you were born.” Then she told her how everything had happened. The girl said, “Dear mother, don’t cry, I will go and find my brothers.”

So the girl took the twelve shirts and went out and straight into the great forest. She walked all day, and in the evening came to the cursed house. She went inside and found a young man sitting there, who asked her, “Where do you come from, and where are you going?” and was amazed that she was so beautiful, wore royal clothes, and had a golden star on her forehead. The girl replied, “I am a princess and I am looking for my twelve brothers and will go as far as the sky is blue until I find them.” She showed him the twelve shirts that belonged to them. Then Benjamin saw that it was his sister and said, “I am Benjamin, your youngest brother.” And the sister began to weep with joy, and Benjamin also, and they kissed and hugged each other with great love. Then Benjamin said, “Dear sister, there is one condition: we had agreed that any girl we met would have to die, because we had to leave our kingdom for the sake of a girl.” The girl said, “I am willing to die if it will save my twelve brothers.” “No,” Benjamin replied, “you must not die, sit under this stool until my eleven brothers come, and then I will make peace with them.” So she did, and when night fell, the others returned from hunting, and the meal was ready. And as they sat at the table and ate, Benjamin said, “Do you know anything new?” “No,” they replied. Benjamin said further, “You have been hunting in the forest, and I have stayed here at home, and I know more than you do.” “Tell us then,” they cried. Benjamin replied, “Our sister is here,” and lifted up the stool, and the princess came out in her royal clothes with the golden star on her forehead, and was so beautiful, delicate, and fine. Then they were all delighted, threw their arms around her neck, and kissed her, and loved her dearly.

Then she stayed with Benjamin at home and helped him with the work. The eleven brothers went out into the forest, hunted game, deer, birds, and what else was edible, and the sister and Benjamin saw to it that the meal was prepared. She also kept the house in order, and made the beds white and clean, and the brothers were always content and lived in great harmony with her.

After a time, the two at home had prepared a beautiful meal, and when they were all together, they sat down, ate, and drank, and were full of joy. There was a small garden next to the cursed house, where twelve lily flowers bloomed, which are also called student flowers. The sister wanted to make a gift for her brothers, broke off the twelve flowers, and thought to give each of them one to eat. But as soon as she had broken off the flowers, the twelve brothers were instantly transformed into twelve ravens and flew away over the forest, and the house with the garden disappeared. Then the poor girl was left alone in the wild forest, and as she looked around, an old woman stood beside her, who said, “My child, what have you done? Why did you leave the twelve white flowers standing? They were your brothers, and now they are forever transformed into ravens.”

The girl wept and said, “Is there no way to save them?” “No,” the old woman replied, “there is none in the world, but it is so difficult that you will not be able to save them. You must be silent for seven years, you must not speak or laugh, and if you speak a single word, and only one hour remains of the seven years, everything will be in vain, and your brothers will be killed by that word.”

The girl thought to herself, “I am certain that I will save my brothers,” and went to find a high tree, sat on it, and spun, and did not speak or laugh. It happened that a king was hunting in the forest, who had a large greyhound, which ran to the tree where the girl was sitting, jumped around, barked, and howled. The king came and saw the beautiful princess with the golden star on her forehead, and was so enchanted by her beauty that he called out to her, “Will you become my wife?” She did not answer, but nodded slightly with her head. The king climbed the tree, took her down, put her on his horse, and took her home. A great wedding was celebrated with great pomp and joy, but the bride did not speak or laugh.

After a few years of happy marriage, the king’s mother, who was a wicked woman, began to slander the young queen and said to the king, “It is a wicked girl that you have brought home, who knows what wicked tricks she is secretly doing. If she is mute and cannot speak, she could at least laugh, but whoever does not laugh has a wicked conscience.” The king did not want to believe it at first, but the old woman kept accusing her of worse and worse things, until the king was finally convinced and condemned her to death.

A great fire was lit in the courtyard, where she was to be burned, and the king stood at the window and wept, because he still loved her so much. And as she was already bound to the stake, and the flames were licking her clothes with red tongues, just at the last moment of the seven years, a commotion was heard in the air, and twelve ravens flew in and settled down. And as they touched the ground, they were her twelve brothers, whom she had saved. They scattered the fire, put out the flames, freed their sister, and kissed and hugged her. Then, as she was finally allowed to speak, she told the king why she had been silent and never laughed. The king was overjoyed when he heard that she was innocent, and they all lived together in harmony until their death. The wicked stepmother was put on trial and put in a barrel filled with boiling oil and poisonous snakes, and died a wicked death. And the girl and her twelve brothers lived happily in the kingdom, and she became queen, and the twelve brothers became princes.
