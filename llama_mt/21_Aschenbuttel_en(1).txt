A rich man had a wife who fell ill, and when she felt her end was near, she called her only daughter to her bedside and said, “Dear child, remain pious and good, and the loving God will always be with you. I will look down upon you from heaven and be around you.” Then she closed her eyes and passed away. The girl went every day to her mother’s grave and wept, and remained pious and good.

When winter came, the snow covered the grave with a white cloth, and when the sun in the spring had drawn it away, the man took another wife. The new wife had two daughters with her, who were beautiful and fair of face, but wicked and black of heart. It was a bad time for the poor stepchild. “Shall the foolish goose sit in our parlor?” they said. “Whoever wants to eat bread must earn it: out with the kitchen maid!” They took away her beautiful clothes and put a grey old dress on her, and gave her wooden shoes. “Look at the proud princess, how she is dressed!” they cried, and laughed and led her into the kitchen. There she had to do hard work from morning to night, get up early, carry water, make fire, cook, and wash. In addition, the sisters did everything they could to make her miserable, mocked her, and poured peas and lentils into the ashes, so that she had to sit and pick them out again. In the evenings, when she was tired from working, she didn’t get into bed, but had to lie down in the ashes beside the hearth. And because she was always dusty and dirty, they called her Cinderella.

One day, the father wanted to go to church, and asked the two stepdaughters what he should bring them. “Beautiful clothes,” said one, “pearls and diamonds,” said the other. “But you, Cinderella,” he said, “what do you want?” “Father, the first thing that touches your hat on your way home, that’s what you should bring me,” she said. He bought beautiful clothes, pearls, and diamonds for the two stepdaughters, and on his way home, as he rode through a green bush, a hazelnut fell onto his hat and knocked it off. He broke off the hazelnut and took it with him. When he came home, he gave the stepdaughters what they had asked for, and to Cinderella, he gave the hazelnut. Cinderella thanked him and went to her mother’s grave under the hazel tree and planted the hazelnut there, and wept so much that her tears fell onto the grave and watered it. It grew, and became a beautiful tree. Cinderella went there three times a day, wept, and prayed, and every time, a white bird came to the tree, and if she made a wish, the bird would drop what she had wished for.

It happened that the king was hosting a three-day festival, and invited all the beautiful maidens in the land to attend, so that his son could choose a bride. The two stepdaughters heard that they were also invited and were delighted, called Cinderella, and said, “Comb our hair, brush our shoes, and fasten our buckles, we’re going to the king’s castle for the wedding.” Cinderella obeyed, but wept because she wanted to go to the dance with them. She begged her stepmother to let her go, but she said, “You, Cinderella, are full of dust and dirt, and you want to go to the wedding? You have no clothes or shoes, and you want to dance!” When she continued to beg, her stepmother finally said, “I’ll give you a chance, but if you can clean the ashes and pick out all the peas and lentils in two hours, then you can go to the wedding.” Cinderella went out the back door into the garden and cried out, “Come, you tame pigeons, you turtledoves, all you birds under heaven, come and help me pick out the peas and lentils, the good ones into the pot, the bad ones into the sieve.” Then two white pigeons flew into the kitchen window, and then the turtledoves, and finally all the birds under heaven flew in and settled around the ashes. The pigeons nodded their heads and started pecking, and the other birds started pecking, and they picked out all the good peas and lentils into the pot. In less than an hour, they were finished, and flew out again. Cinderella brought the pot to her stepmother, was happy, and thought she could now go to the wedding. But her stepmother said, “It won’t do you any good, you’re still not going, because you have no clothes and can’t dance; we’d be ashamed of you.” She turned her back on Cinderella and ran off with her two proud daughters.

When no one was at home, Cinderella went to her mother’s grave under the hazel tree and said,

“Hazel tree, shake yourself and shake yourself,
throw gold and silver over me.”

The bird dropped a beautiful golden and silver dress on her, and with silk and silver embroidered slippers. In a hurry, she put on the dress and went to the wedding. Her sisters and stepmother didn’t recognize her, and thought she must be a foreign princess, so beautiful did she look in the golden dress. They didn’t think of Cinderella at all, and thought she was still at home, sitting in the ashes and picking out the peas and lentils. The king’s son came to her, took her by the hand, and danced only with her. When others came and invited her to dance, he said, “This is my dancer.” When it was evening, she wanted to go home, and the king’s son wanted to accompany her, but she escaped from him and ran into the garden behind the house. There was a beautiful large tree with the most beautiful pears hanging from it, and she climbed up into the branches like a squirrel, and the king’s son couldn’t find her. He waited until her father came and said, “The foreign girl has escaped, and I think she climbed up the pear tree.” The father thought, “Could it be Cinderella?” and had an axe brought and chopped down the tree, but there was no one on it. And when they came into the kitchen, Cinderella was lying in the ashes as usual, because she had climbed down the other side of the tree, had brought the beautiful clothes back to the hazel tree, and put on her grey dress again.

On the third day, when her parents and sisters were away, Cinderella went to her mother’s grave and said to the hazel tree,

“Hazel tree, shake yourself and shake yourself,
throw gold and silver over me.”

The bird dropped a dress on her that was even more beautiful and glittering than the previous ones, and the slippers were made of pure gold. When she came to the wedding in the dress, everyone was amazed at her beauty. The king’s son danced only with her, and when others invited her to dance, he said, “This is my dancer.” When it was evening, Cinderella wanted to go home, and the king’s son wanted to accompany her, but she escaped from him so quickly that he couldn’t follow her. The king’s son had used a trick, and had the whole staircase smeared with pitch, so that when Cinderella ran down, her left slipper got stuck. The king’s son picked it up, and it was small and delicate and made of pure gold. The next morning, he went with it to the man and said, “No other woman shall be my bride except the one whose foot fits this golden shoe.” The two stepdaughters were delighted, and the older one went into the room with the shoe and wanted to try it on, and her mother was there. But she couldn’t get her big toe into the shoe, and it was too small for her. Her mother said, “Cut off your toe! When you’re queen, you won’t have to walk anymore.” The girl cut off her toe, put her foot into the shoe, and went out to the king’s son. He took her as his bride and rode off with her. But as they passed by the hazel tree, the two white pigeons were sitting on it, and cried out,

“Look, look,
blood in the shoe:
the shoe is too small,
the right bride is still at home.”

The king’s son looked down at her foot and saw the blood oozing out of the shoe and staining her white stockings. He turned his horse around and brought the false bride back home. “This isn’t the right one,” he said. “Do you have any other daughter?” “No,” said the man, “only my late wife’s little Cinderella is left, and that’s impossible to be the bride.” The king’s son said he should be brought up, and the mother said, “Oh no, she’s too dirty, she can’t be seen.” But he insisted, and Cinderella had to be called. She washed her hands and face, went up, and bowed to the king’s son, who gave her the golden shoe. Then she sat down on a stool, took off her foot from the heavy wooden shoe, and put it into the slipper, which fit perfectly. When she stood up and the king looked at her, he recognized the beautiful girl who had danced with him, and cried out, “This is the right bride!” The stepmother and the two stepdaughters were shocked and pale with anger. But the king took Cinderella on his horse and rode off with her. As they passed by the hazel tree, the two white pigeons cried out,

“Look, look,
no blood in the shoe:
the shoe fits,
the right bride, she leads him home.”

And as they finished saying this, they flew down and perched on Cinderella’s shoulders, one on the right, the other on the left, and stayed there.

When the wedding with the king’s son was to be held, the two false sisters came, wanting to flatter and share in his happiness. When the bride and groom went to the church, the older sister was on the right, the younger on the left, and the pigeons pecked out one eye each. Then, when they came out, the older sister was on the left, and the younger on the right, and the pigeons pecked out the other eye each. And so, they were punished for their wickedness and deceit with blindness for the rest of their lives.
