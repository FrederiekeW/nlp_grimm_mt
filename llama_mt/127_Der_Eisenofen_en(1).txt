In times when wishing still helped, a king's son was cursed by an old witch to sit in a large iron oven in the forest. He spent many years there and couldn't be freed. One day, a king's daughter wandered into the forest, having lost her way and unable to find her father's kingdom. She had been walking for nine days and stood in front of the iron oven. A voice came out and asked her, "Where do you come from, and where are you going?" She replied, "I've lost my father's kingdom and can't find my way back home." The voice from the oven said, "I'll help you get back home quickly, but you must sign an agreement with me. I'm a greater king's son than you are a king's daughter, and I want to marry you." She was frightened and thought, "Dear God, what am I to do with this iron oven?" But since she wanted to get back home, she agreed to sign the agreement. The voice from the oven said, "You must come back with a knife and scratch a hole in the iron." He gave her a companion to accompany her, but he didn't speak. He brought her back to her father's kingdom in two hours. There was great joy in the castle when the king's daughter returned, and the old king fell at her feet and kissed her. But she was very upset and said, "Dear Father, what happened to me! I wouldn't have come back from the great, wild forest if I hadn't met the iron oven, and I had to sign an agreement to come back and free it, and marry it." The old king was so shocked that he almost fainted, because he had only one daughter.

They consulted with each other and decided to replace her with a miller's daughter, who was beautiful. They took her out, gave her a knife, and told her to scratch the iron oven. She scratched for 24 hours, but couldn't get anything. When the day broke, the voice from the oven said, "I think it's day outside." The miller's daughter replied, "I think so too; I hear my father's mill grinding." "So you're a miller's daughter; go outside and let the king's daughter come in." She went out and said to the old king, "I won't go; I want my daughter." The old king was shocked, and the daughter cried. They had another daughter, a swineherd's daughter, who was even more beautiful than the miller's daughter. They offered her some money to go to the iron oven in the king's daughter's place. So they took her out and told her to scratch the oven for 24 hours. But she couldn't get anything. When the day broke, the voice from the oven said, "I think it's day outside." The swineherd's daughter replied, "I think so too; I hear my father's pigs squealing." "So you're a swineherd's daughter; go away and let the king's daughter come in. And tell her that if she doesn't come, the whole kingdom will collapse and no stone will remain on top of another." The king's daughter heard this and began to cry. But there was nothing else to do; she had to keep her promise. So she took leave of her father, put a knife in her belt, and went to the iron oven in the forest.

When she arrived, she started scratching, and the iron gave way, and after two hours, she had made a small hole. She looked inside and saw a handsome young man, who glimmered with gold and precious stones. She was immediately taken with him. So she scratched some more and made the hole bigger, and he was able to come out. He said, "You are mine, and I am yours; you are my bride, and you have freed me." He wanted to take her to his kingdom, but she asked if she could visit her father one more time. He agreed, but said she should only speak three words to him, and then she had to come back. So she went home, but spoke more than three words to her father, and the iron oven disappeared, taking the king's son with it. It was moved far away over glass mountains and cutting swords. But the king's son was free, and no longer trapped in the oven. After that, the king's daughter took leave of her father, took some money with her, but not much, and went back to the forest to find the iron oven. But it was nowhere to be found. She searched for nine days, and her hunger became so great that she didn't know what to do, because she had nothing to eat. And when evening came, she sat on a small tree and thought she would spend the night there, because she was afraid of the wild animals. When midnight came, she saw a small light in the distance and thought, "Ah, I'll be rescued!" So she got down from the tree and followed the light. She prayed as she walked. She came to a small, old house, and there was a lot of grass around it, and a small pile of wood in front of it. She thought, "Where am I?" She looked through the window and saw nothing but toads, but a table was set with wine and meat, and the plates and cups were made of silver. So she took a deep breath and knocked on the door.

The toad immediately said:

"Jungfer grün und klein,
Hutzelbein,
Hutzelbeins Hündchen,
hutzel hin und her,
bring mir die große Schachtel her."

(The translation of this is a bit tricky, but it roughly means: "Little green maiden, Hutzelbein, Hutzelbein's puppy, go and fetch me the big box.")

She went and brought the box, and they gave her food and drink, and brought her to a beautiful, made bed, which was like silk and velvet. She lay down in it and fell asleep. When the day came, she got up and they gave her three needles from the big box, which she should take with her. She would need them, because she had to cross a high glass mountain, three cutting swords, and a large lake. If she succeeded, she would get her beloved back. They also gave her three things to keep in mind: three large needles, a plowshare, and three nuts. With these, she set off, and when she came to the glass mountain, she stuck the needles behind her feet and then in front of her, and she was able to cross it. When she came to the three cutting swords, she stood on the plowshare and rolled over them. Finally, she came to the large lake, and when she crossed it, she came to a large, beautiful castle. She went inside and asked for a job as a servant, saying she was a poor maid and wanted to rent herself out. But she knew the king's son was inside, whom she had freed from the iron oven in the forest. So they accepted her as a kitchen maid for a low wage.

The king's son had already taken another woman as his bride, because he thought the king's daughter was dead. Every evening, after she had washed up and was finished with her work, she would feel in her pocket and find the three nuts that the old toad had given her. She would bite one of them and find a beautiful, royal dress inside. The king's bride would see this and want to buy it, but the kitchen maid would refuse to sell it to her. But she would offer to give it to her if she was allowed to sleep in the king's son's bedchamber one more time. The king's bride would agree, because the dress was so beautiful and she had none like it. But the kitchen maid would give her a sleeping draught and the king's son would sleep so soundly that she couldn't wake him up. She would cry and scream all night, saying, "Dear beloved, I freed you from the wild forest and from the iron oven, I searched for you and crossed the glass mountain, the three cutting swords, and the large lake, and now you don't want to listen to me!" The servants would sit outside the door and hear her crying and screaming all night, and they would tell the king's son in the morning.

The next evening, she would bite another nut and find an even more beautiful dress inside. The king's bride would see this and want to buy it, but the kitchen maid would refuse to sell it to her. But she would offer to give it to her if she was allowed to sleep in the king's son's bedchamber one more time. The king's bride would agree, and the kitchen maid would give her a sleeping draught and the king's son would sleep so soundly that she couldn't wake him up. She would cry and scream all night, saying, "Dear beloved, I freed you from the wild forest and from the iron oven, I searched for you and crossed the glass mountain, the three cutting swords, and the large lake, and now you don't want to listen to me!" The servants would sit outside the door and hear her crying and screaming all night, and they would tell the king's son in the morning.

The next evening, she would bite the third nut and find a dress that was even more beautiful, made of pure gold. The king's bride would see this and want to buy it, but the kitchen maid would refuse to sell it to her. But she would offer to give it to her if she was allowed to sleep in the king's son's bedchamber one more time. This time, the king's son would be awake and would say, "You are the right one, you are mine, and I am yours." So they would get in a carriage and take the false bride's clothes away from her, so she couldn't get up. They would cross the large lake, and then they would stand on the plowshare and roll over the three cutting swords. Finally, they would stick the needles in the glass mountain, and they would come to the old, small house, but it was now a large castle. The toads were all freed and were now all king's children, and they were in a state of great joy. A wedding was held, and they lived in the castle, which was much larger than the king's castle. But the old king was sad that he would be left alone, so they went to fetch him, and they had two kingdoms and lived happily ever after.
