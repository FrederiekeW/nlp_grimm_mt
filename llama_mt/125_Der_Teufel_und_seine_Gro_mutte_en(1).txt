It was a great war, and the king had many soldiers, but he gave them little pay, so they could not live on it. Then three of them got together and wanted to desert. One of them said to the other, “If we are caught, we will be hanged on the gallows tree: how will we do it?” The other replied, “Look over there, at the big cornfield. If we hide there, no one will find us: the army cannot enter and must march on tomorrow.” They crawled into the corn, but the army did not march on, but instead lay encamped all around them. They sat there for two days and two nights in the corn and had such great hunger that they almost died: but if they came out, they were sure to die. Then they said to each other, “What good is our desertion, we must die miserably here.” Just then a fiery dragon flew through the air, descended upon them, and asked them why they were hiding. They replied, “We are three soldiers, and we deserted because our pay was too low: now we must die of hunger here, or hang on the gallows tree if we go out.” “Will you serve me for seven years,” said the dragon, “I will lead you through the middle of the army, so that no one will catch you?” “We have no choice and must accept,” they replied. Then the dragon grabbed them in his claws, took them through the air over the army, and set them down far away from it; but the dragon was none other than the devil.

He gave them a small whip and said, “whip and crack with that, and as much money as you want will spring up before you: you can then live like great lords, keep horses and ride in carriages: after the seven years, however, you are mine.” Then he showed them a book in which they had to sign their names. “But I will give you,” he said, “one more riddle to solve: if you can solve it, you will be free and released from my power.” Then the dragon flew away from them, and they traveled on with their whips, had a lot of money, had themselves made fine clothes, and roamed the world. Wherever they were, they lived in joy and grandeur, rode horses and carriages, ate and drank, and did nothing evil. The time passed quickly, and when the seven years were up, two of them were very afraid and anxious, but the third took it lightly and said, “Brothers, do not be afraid, I am not foolish, I will solve the riddle.” They went out into the field, sat down, and the two made sad faces. Then an old woman came by, who asked them why they were so sad. “Ah, what does it matter to you, you cannot help us,” they replied. “Who knows,” she said, “just trust me with your troubles.” Then they told her that they had been the devil’s servants for almost seven years, that he had given them a lot of money, but that they had signed themselves over to him, and that they would be his if they did not solve the riddle. The old woman said, “If you want to be helped, one of you must go into the forest, there he will come to a fallen rock wall that looks like a little house, into which he must enter, and there he will find help.” The two sad ones thought, “This will not save us,” and sat still, but the third, the cheerful one, got up and went into the forest until he found the little house. Inside the house sat an old woman, who was the devil’s grandmother, and asked him where he came from and what he wanted. He told her everything that had happened, and because she liked him, she had pity on him and said she would help him. She picked up a big stone that lay over a cellar, and said, “Hide yourself there, you can hear everything that is said here, just sit still and don’t move: when the dragon comes, I will ask him about the riddle, and then listen to what he answers.” At midnight, the dragon came flying and asked for his dinner. The grandmother set the table and brought food and drink, so that he was pleased, and they ate and drank together. Then she asked him in conversation how the day had gone and how many souls he had caught. “It didn’t go well for me today,” he replied, “but I caught three soldiers, they are mine for sure.” “Yes, three soldiers,” she said, “they have something about them, they can still escape.” The devil sneered, “They are mine, I will give them another riddle that they will never be able to solve.” “What is the riddle?” she asked. “I will tell you,” he said, “in the big North Sea lies a dead sea cat, that will be your roast: and from a wallfish, the rib, that will be your silver spoon: and an old hollow horse hoof, that will be your wine glass.” When the devil went to bed, the old grandmother lifted the stone and let the soldier out. “Did you pay attention to everything?” she asked. “Yes,” he replied, “I know enough and will help myself.” Then he had to sneak back to his comrades on a different path through the window in a hurry. He told them how the devil had been outwitted by the old grandmother and how he had heard the solution to the riddle from him. Then they were all happy and in good spirits, took the whip and struck out so much money that it sprang up on the ground. When the seven years were completely up, the devil came with the book, showed them the signatures, and said, “I will take you to hell, where you will have a meal: if you can tell me what kind of roast you will get to eat, you will be free and released from my power and can keep the whip.” Then the first soldier began, “In the big North Sea lies a dead sea cat, that will be your roast.” The devil was angry, made a “hm! hm! hm!” and asked the second, “But what will be your silver spoon?” “From a wallfish, the rib,” the second replied. The devil cut a face, growled again three times “hm! hm! hm!” and asked the third, “Do you also know what your wine glass will be?” “An old horse hoof,” the third replied. Then the devil flew away with a loud scream and had no more power over them: but the three kept the whip, struck out as much money as they wanted, and lived happily until the end.
