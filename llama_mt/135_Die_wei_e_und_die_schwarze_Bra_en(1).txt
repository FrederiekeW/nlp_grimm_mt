A woman went with her daughter and stepdaughter to the fields to cut hay. Then the good God came to them as a poor man and asked, “Where is the path to the village?” The mother replied, “If you want to know, you can find it yourself.” The daughter added, “If you are worried that you won’t find it, take a signpost with you.” But the stepdaughter said, “Poor man, I will guide you, come with me.” Then the good God was angry with the mother and daughter and turned his back on them, cursing them to become as black as the night and as ugly as sin. But he was gracious to the stepdaughter and went with her, and when they were near the village, he blessed her and said, “Choose three things, and I will grant them to you.” The girl said, “I would like to be as beautiful and pure as the sun.” Immediately she became white and beautiful like the day. “Then I would like to have a purse that never runs out of money,” she said. The good God granted her that too, but said, “Don’t forget the best thing.” She said, “I would like to have the eternal kingdom of heaven after my death.” That was also granted to her, and so the good God parted from her.

When the stepmother and her daughter came home from the fields and saw that they were both as black as coal and ugly, while the stepdaughter was white and beautiful, the stepmother’s wickedness increased, and she had only one thought in mind: how she could harm her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter, however, loved her brother Reginer dearly and told him everything that had happened. Reginer said to her one day, “Dear sister, I want to paint you so that I can always look at you, because my love for you is so great that I want to look at you all the time.” The girl replied, “But please, don’t let anyone see the picture.” He painted her, and hung the picture in his room. He lived in the king’s castle because he was the king’s coachman. Every day, he would stand before the picture and thank God for his sister’s good fortune. But the king, whose wife had recently died, was in deep sorrow because he could not find a woman as beautiful as his late wife. The courtiers noticed that the coachman was always standing before the beautiful picture and envied him, and they reported it to the king. The king ordered the picture to be brought before him, and when he saw that it was a perfect likeness of his late wife, only more beautiful, he fell deeply in love with it. He ordered the coachman to be brought before him and asked him who the picture represented. The coachman said it was his sister, and the king decided to take no other wife but her. He gave the coachman a carriage and horses and fine golden clothes and sent him off to fetch his chosen bride. When Reginer arrived with the news, his sister was overjoyed, but the black woman was consumed with envy and said to her mother, “What good are all your tricks now, since you can’t even get me such a good fortune?” “Be quiet,” said the old woman, “I’ll take care of it.” And through her witchcraft, she blinded the coachman so that he was half-blind, and she stopped the ears of the white girl so that she was half-deaf. Then they got into the carriage, with the black woman dressed in the king’s fine clothes, the stepmother and her daughter, and Reginer driving. As they traveled for a while, the coachman cried out, “Cover yourself, my little sister, so that the rain doesn’t wet you, so that the wind doesn’t blow dust on you, and you’ll be fine and beautiful for the king.” The bride asked, “What does my dear brother say?” The old woman replied, “He says you should take off your golden dress and give it to your sister.” So she took it off and gave it to the black woman, who put on a poor, grey dress in exchange. They continued on their way, and after a while, the coachman cried out again, “Cover yourself, my little sister, so that the rain doesn’t wet you, so that the wind doesn’t blow dust on you, and you’ll be fine and beautiful for the king.” The bride asked, “What does my dear brother say?” The old woman replied, “He says you should take off your golden hat and give it to your sister.” So she took it off and gave it to the black woman, who put it on and sat in the carriage without any clothes on her head. They continued on their way, and after a while, the coachman cried out once more, “Cover yourself, my little sister, so that the rain doesn’t wet you, so that the wind doesn’t blow dust on you, and you’ll be fine and beautiful for the king.” The bride asked, “What does my dear brother say?” The old woman replied, “He says you should want to look out of the carriage.” Just then, they were crossing a bridge over a deep river. When the bride stood up and leaned out of the carriage, they both fell out and into the water, where they drowned. At the same moment, a white swan emerged from the water and swam down the river. The coachman didn’t notice anything and continued driving the carriage until they arrived at the king’s castle. There, he brought the black woman before the king, claiming she was his sister, but because he was half-blind and saw only the golden clothes, the king was furious and ordered the coachman to be thrown into a pit filled with snakes and otters. But the old witch knew how to blind the king with her witchcraft, so that he kept the black woman and her daughter, and even thought they were quite pleasant, and he decided to marry her.

One evening, while the black bride was sitting on the king’s lap, a white swan came swimming into the kitchen and said to the kitchen boy, “Boy, make a fire so I can warm my feathers.” The kitchen boy did as he was told and made a fire on the hearth. The swan came and sat beside it, shaking itself and smoothing its feathers with its beak. While it was sitting there, it asked, “What is my brother Reginer doing?” The kitchen boy replied, “He is lying in the pit, caught by snakes and otters.” The swan asked, “What is the black witch doing in the house?” The kitchen boy replied, “She is sitting warm in the king’s lap.” The swan said, “Oh, how terrible!” and swam out of the kitchen.

The next evening, the swan came back and asked the same questions, and the third evening, it asked again. The kitchen boy couldn’t bear it any longer and went to the king and told him everything. The king wanted to see it for himself and went to the kitchen on the fourth evening. When the swan stuck its head through the window, the king took his sword and struck it, and at once, it turned into the most beautiful girl, identical to the picture that Reginer had painted. The king was overjoyed, and because she was wet, he ordered fine clothes to be brought and had her dressed in them. Then she told him how she had been deceived and betrayed by the black witch and finally thrown into the river. Her first wish was that her brother be rescued from the snake pit. And when the king granted her this wish, he went to the room where the old witch was sitting and asked her, “What should be done with the one who has done this and that?” And he told her what had happened. The old witch was so blinded by her own wickedness that she didn’t notice anything and said, “She should be stripped naked and put in a barrel with nails, and a horse should be harnessed to the barrel and sent out into the world.” This was done to her and her black daughter. The king, however, married the white and beautiful bride and rewarded Reginer by making him a rich and respected man. And the girl was so grateful that she never forgot the beauty and purity that God had granted her.
