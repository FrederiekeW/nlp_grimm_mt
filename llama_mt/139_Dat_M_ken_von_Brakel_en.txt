And then a young woman from Brakel near St. Anne's Chapel and the Hinnenborg, because she wanted a man and also thought it would be nice to be in the chapel, so she said:

‘O holy St. Anne,
help me quickly with the man.
You know him well:
he lives in the Suttmerdor,
he has good ears:
you know him well.’

The sacristan stood before the altar and heard this, and he replied with a completely bewildered voice ‘you won’t get one, you won’t get one.’ The young woman, however, thought that the little statue of Mary, which stands next to St. Anne, had called out, and so she was angry and said ‘pepperlepep, stupid fool, hold your nose and let the mother speak (the mother talk).’ The sacristan then stood there and heard the whole commotion, and he replied with a bewildered voice ‘you won’t get one, you won’t get one.’
