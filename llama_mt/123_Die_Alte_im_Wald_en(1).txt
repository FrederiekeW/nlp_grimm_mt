Once upon a time, a poor servant girl was traveling with her mistress through a large forest, and as they were in the middle of it, robbers emerged from the underbrush and murdered anyone they found. Everyone perished except for the girl, who was frightened and jumped out of the carriage and hid behind a tree. When the robbers had taken their loot and left, she emerged from her hiding place and saw the great disaster. She began to weep bitterly and said, ‘What am I to do, poor girl? I don’t know how to find my way out of the forest; no human being lives here, so I must certainly starve to death.’ She wandered around, searching for a path, but could not find one. When evening came, she sat down under a tree, prayed to God, and wanted to stay there and not leave, no matter what might happen. But after a while, a white dove flew to her and had a small golden key in its beak. The dove put the key in her hand and said, ‘Do you see that large tree over there? There is a small castle attached to it, and you can open it with this key. Inside, you will find enough food to eat and no longer suffer from hunger.’ The girl went to the tree and opened it up, and inside, she found milk in a small bowl and white bread to eat, so she could satisfy her hunger. When she was full, she said, ‘Now it’s time for the chickens to go home; I am so tired, I could just go to bed.’ The dove flew back and brought another golden key in its beak and said, ‘Open that tree, and you will find a bed.’ She opened it up and found a beautiful, soft bed, so she prayed to the dear God to protect her in the night, lay down, and fell asleep. In the morning, the dove came back a third time, brought another key, and said, ‘Open that tree, and you will find clothes.’ And when she opened it, she found clothes with gold and precious stones set into them, so magnificent that no princess has them. So she lived there for a while, and the dove came every day and took care of everything she needed, and it was a quiet, good life.

One day, the dove came and said, ‘Will you do something for me out of love?’ ‘With all my heart,’ said the girl. The dove said, ‘I want to take you to a small cottage. Go inside, and in the middle of the room, there will be an old woman sitting by the hearth and saying ‘good day.’ But give her no answer, no matter what she says, and go to her right hand and open the door there, so you will come into a room where there are many rings of all kinds on the table, including beautiful ones with glittering stones. Leave those alone and search for a simple one, which must be there too, and bring it to me as quickly as you can.’ The girl went to the cottage and entered through the door: there was an old woman sitting there, who made a big show of her eyes when she saw her and said, ‘Good day, my child.’ But the girl gave her no answer and went to the door. ‘Where are you going?’ she cried and grabbed her by the skirt, wanting to hold her back. ‘This is my house, and no one may enter unless I want it.’ But the girl remained silent, broke free, and went straight into the room. There was a huge number of rings on the table, shining and sparkling before her eyes: she tossed them around and searched for the simple one, but couldn’t find it. As she searched, she saw the old woman creeping along, carrying a birdcage in her hand and wanting to take it away. The girl went up to her and took the cage out of her hand, and when she looked inside, a bird was sitting there with the simple ring in its beak. She took the ring and ran out of the house, thinking the white dove would come and take the ring, but it didn’t. She leaned against a tree and waited for the dove, and as she stood there, the tree seemed soft and pliable, and its branches lowered down. And all of a sudden, the branches wrapped themselves around her, and became two arms, and when she looked around, the tree had become a handsome man, who embraced her and kissed her warmly and said, ‘You have freed me and delivered me from the old woman’s power, who is a wicked witch. She had transformed me into a tree, and every day, I was a white dove for a few hours, and as long as she had the ring, I could not regain my human form.’ The old woman had also transformed his servants and horses into trees, and they were standing beside him. They then rode off to his kingdom, since he was the son of a king, and they got married and lived happily. And so, the girl, who had once been so poor and wretched, found the happiness she could never have imagined.
