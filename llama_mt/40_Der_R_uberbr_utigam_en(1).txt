There was once a miller who had a beautiful daughter, and when she had grown up, he wished she were provided for and well married. He thought, “If a respectable suitor comes and asks for her hand, I will give her to him.” Not long after, a suitor came who seemed very wealthy, and since the miller could find nothing wrong with him, he promised him his daughter. But the girl did not love him as a bride should love her bridegroom, and she had no trust in him. Every time she looked at him or thought of him, she felt a shiver in her heart. One day, he said to her, “You are my bride, and you do not visit me at all.” The girl replied, “I do not know where your house is.” The bridegroom said, “My house is outside in the dark forest.” She sought excuses and said it might be hard to find the way there. The bridegroom said, “Next Sunday you must come to me, I have already invited guests, and so that you can find the way through the forest, I will sprinkle ashes along the path.” When Sunday came, and the girl was supposed to set out, she felt a strange fear, and in order to be able to mark the path, she stuffed both her pockets with beans and lentils. At the entrance to the forest, ashes were scattered, and she followed them, but threw beans to the left and right with every step. She walked almost the whole day until she came to the darkest part of the forest, where a solitary house stood. It did not please her, for it looked so dark and eerie. She entered it, but it was empty and there was complete silence. Suddenly, a voice cried out,

“Turn back, turn back, young bride,
you are in a murderer’s house.”

The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird perched on a beam in the wall. The bird cried out again,

“Turn back, turn back, young bride,
you are in a murderer’s house.”

The beautiful bride went from room to room, and went through the entire house, but it was all empty and there was no human soul to be found. Finally, she came to the cellar, where an old woman sat, shaking her head. “Can you tell me,” said the girl, “if my bridegroom lives here?” “Oh, poor child,” replied the old woman, “where have you gone astray! You think you are a bride who will soon be married, but you will hold your wedding with death. Look, I have had to boil a great cauldron of water, for when they get hold of you, they will cut you up without mercy, cook you, and eat you, for they are cannibals. If I had not taken pity on you and saved you, you would be lost.”

The old woman then led the girl behind a large barrel, where she could not be seen. “Be as quiet as a mouse,” she said, “do not stir and do not move, or it will be your downfall. When the robbers are asleep at night, we will escape, for I have been waiting for a chance for a long time.” No sooner had they done this than the band of robbers arrived home. They brought another young woman with them, were drunk, and did not stop her screaming and crying. They gave her three glasses of wine to drink, one white, one red, and one yellow, and her heart burst. They then ripped off her fine clothes, laid them on a table, cut her beautiful body into pieces, and sprinkled salt over them. The poor bride, who was hiding behind the barrel, trembled and shook with fear, for she saw what fate the robbers had in store for her. One of them noticed a golden ring on the finger of the murdered woman, and when it would not come off, he took an axe and hacked off the finger. But the finger sprang into the air over the barrel and fell into the bride’s lap. The robber took a light and tried to find it, but could not. Then another said, “Have you also looked behind the large barrel?” But the old woman cried out, “Come and eat, and do not bother looking for it until morning: the finger will not get away from you.”

The robbers said, “The old woman is right,” and gave up looking. They sat down to eat, and the old woman poured a sleep-inducing draught into their wine, so that they soon fell asleep and began to snore. When the bride heard this, she came out from behind the barrel and had to walk over the sleeping robbers, who lay in rows on the ground, without waking any of them. But God helped her, and she escaped safely. The old woman climbed up with her and opened the door, and they ran as fast as they could out of the murderer’s den. The ashes that had been scattered had been blown away by the wind, but the beans and lentils had sprouted and grown, and in the moonlight, they showed the way. They walked the whole night until they arrived at the mill in the morning. There, the girl told her father everything that had happened to her.

When the day arrived when the wedding was to take place, the bridegroom appeared, but the miller had invited all his relatives and acquaintances. When they sat down to eat, it was suggested that each person tell a story. The bride sat quietly and did not speak. The bridegroom said to the bride, “Now, my heart, don’t you know anything? Tell us something too.” She replied, “I will tell a dream. I went alone through a forest and came to a house, where there was no human being, but a bird was perched on a beam on the wall, and it cried out,

“Turn back, turn back, young bride,
you are in a murderer’s house.”

And it cried it out again. My dear, that was just a dream. I went from room to room, and all were empty, and it was so eerie in there; I went down into the cellar, where an old woman sat, shaking her head. I asked her, ‘Does my bridegroom live in this house?’ She replied, ‘Oh, poor child, you have gone astray! You think you are a bride who will soon be married, but you will hold your wedding with death. Your bridegroom lives here, but he wants to cut you up and kill you, and then cook and eat you, for he is a cannibal.’ My dear, that was just a dream. But the old woman hid me behind a large barrel, and just as I was hidden, the robbers came home and brought another young woman with them, gave her three glasses of wine to drink, one white, one red, and one yellow, and her heart burst. My dear, that was just a dream. They then ripped off her fine clothes, cut her beautiful body into pieces on a table, and sprinkled salt over them. My dear, that was just a dream. And one of the robbers noticed that the golden ring on the murdered woman’s finger was still stuck, and because it would not come off, he took an axe and hacked off the finger, but the finger sprang into the air and fell into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.”

As she spoke, she pulled out the finger and showed it to the assembly.

The robber, who had turned white as a ghost during the telling of the story, sprang up and tried to flee, but the guests caught him and handed him over to the authorities. Then he and his entire gang were punished for their atrocities. The miller gave his daughter to the king, who made her his daughter, and the girl lived happily and contentedly in the royal palace. The old woman, who had saved her, became her nurse, and the bride and the old woman lived happily and contentedly in the royal palace.
