It was a poor man and a poor woman who had nothing but a small hut, and they lived by fishing, and they went from hand to mouth. But it happened one day, as the man was sitting by the water and casting his net, that he pulled out a fish that was entirely golden. And as he looked at the fish in wonder, it began to speak and said, ‘Hear, fisherman, if you throw me back into the water, I will make your small hut into a grand castle.’ The fisherman replied, ‘What good would a castle do me if I have nothing to eat?’ The golden fish continued, ‘And for food, too, you will be taken care of; there will be a pantry in the castle, and when you open it, you will find dishes filled with the most beautiful foods, as much as you wish.’ ‘If that is so,’ said the man, ‘then I can do you a favor.’ ‘Yes,’ said the fish, ‘but the condition is that you must not tell anyone in the world, whoever it may be, how you came to have your good fortune; if you say a single word, everything will be undone.’

Now the man threw the wonderful fish back into the water and went home. But where his hut used to stand, there now stood a large castle. He looked around, entered it, and saw his wife, who was dressed in beautiful clothes, sitting in a grand room. She was completely happy and said, ‘Husband, how did this come about suddenly? I like it very much.’ ‘Yes,’ said the man, ‘I like it too, but I am also very hungry; give me something to eat first.’ Said the woman, ‘I have nothing, and I don’t know what to find in the new house.’ ‘That’s not a problem,’ said the man, ‘I see a large pantry over there; just open it.’ When she opened the pantry, there was cake, meat, fruit, wine, and they both laughed and enjoyed themselves. When they were full, the woman asked, ‘But, husband, where did all this wealth come from?’ ‘Ah,’ he replied, ‘don’t ask me that; if I tell anyone, our good fortune will be gone.’ ‘Good,’ said the woman, ‘if I don’t know, then I won’t ask.’ But that was not her true intention; it left her no peace, day and night, and she nagged and pestered the man until he, in his impatience, said that it came from a wonderful golden fish that he had caught and then released back into the water. And as soon as he said that, the beautiful castle with the pantry disappeared, and they were back in their old fisherman’s hut.

The man had to start again from scratch, going back to his trade of fishing. But it was his luck that he pulled out the golden fish again. ‘Hear, fisherman,’ said the fish, ‘if you throw me back into the water, I will give you back the castle with the pantry full of cooked and roasted food; just be careful and don’t betray anyone about where your good fortune comes from, or everything will be undone again.’ ‘I will be careful,’ replied the fisherman, and threw the fish back into the water. Back home, everything was again in its former grandeur, and the woman was overjoyed at their good fortune. But curiosity again got the better of her, and she asked after a few days how it had happened and how he had gotten it. The man was silent for a while, but eventually, she nagged him so much that he blurted out the secret. In that instant, the castle disappeared, and they were back in their old hut. ‘Well, now you have it,’ said the man, ‘now we can go back to eating at the tablecloth again.’ ‘Ah,’ said the woman, ‘I would rather not have the wealth if I don’t know where it comes from; otherwise, I have no peace.’

The man went back to fishing, and it was the same for a while; he pulled out the golden fish again. ‘Hear, fisherman,’ said the fish, ‘I see that I always fall into your hands; take me home and cut me into six pieces; give two to your wife to eat, two to your horse, and two bury in the earth; you will have good luck from them.’ The man took the fish home and did as the fish had told him. But it happened that from the two pieces buried in the earth, two golden lilies grew, and that the horse had two golden foals, and the fisherman’s wife gave birth to two children who were entirely golden.

The children grew up, became big and beautiful, and the lilies and horses grew with them. Then they said, ‘Father, we want to ride on our golden horses and go out into the world.’ But he replied, ‘How will I manage if you leave and I don’t know where you are going?’ They said, ‘The two golden lilies will stay here; you can see from them where we are: if they are fresh, we are healthy; if they are wilted, we are sick; if they fall, we are dead.’ They rode off and came to an inn, where many people were. When they saw the two golden children, they began to laugh and mock them. When one of them heard the mocking, he was ashamed and didn’t want to go out into the world; he turned back and came home to his father. The other, however, rode on and came to a large forest. And when he wanted to ride through it, the people said, ‘You can’t do that; the forest is full of robbers who will treat you badly, and if they see that you are golden and your horses are too, they will kill you.’ But he wasn’t afraid and said, ‘I must and will go through.’ So he covered himself and his horse with bear skins so that nothing of the gold was visible, and rode boldly into the forest. After a little while, he heard the rustling of leaves and heard voices talking to each other. From one side, someone said, ‘There’s one,’ but from the other side, someone said, ‘Leave him alone; he’s a bear-hunter, and he’s poor and bald, like a church mouse; what shall we do with him?’ So the golden child rode safely through the forest and nothing bad happened to him.

One day, he came to a village, where he saw a girl who was so beautiful that he didn’t believe there could be a more beautiful one in the world. And because he had such a great love for her, he went to her and said, ‘I love you from the bottom of my heart; will you be my wife?’ He also pleased her so much that she agreed and said, ‘Yes, I will be your wife and be faithful to you forever.’ They held their wedding together, and when they were in the greatest joy, the bride’s father came home, and when he saw that his daughter was getting married, he was surprised and said, ‘Where is the bridegroom?’ They showed him the golden child, but he still had his bear skins on. Then the father, angry, said, ‘Nevermore shall a bear-hunter have my daughter,’ and wanted to kill him. The bride begged him, saying, ‘He is my husband, and I love him from the bottom of my heart,’ until he finally calmed down. But it didn’t leave him, and the next morning, he got up early and wanted to see his daughter’s husband to see if he was a common and wretched beggar.

But when he looked, he saw a magnificent, golden man in bed, and the bear skins lay on the ground. Then he went back and thought, ‘How good it is that I restrained my anger; I would have committed a great wrong.’ The golden child dreamed that he was going out hunting after a magnificent stag, and when he woke up in the morning, he said to his bride, ‘I want to go out hunting.’ She was afraid and begged him to stay, saying, ‘You can easily have a great misfortune.’ But he replied, ‘I must and will go.’ So he got up and went out into the forest, and not long after, he saw a proud stag in front of him, just as he had dreamed. He loaded his gun and wanted to shoot it, but the stag jumped away. Then he chased after it, over a ditch and through bushes, and didn’t tire all day. But in the evening, the stag disappeared from his eyes. And when the golden child looked around, he saw himself in front of a small house, where a witch was sitting. He knocked on the door, and an old woman came out and asked, ‘What do you want so late in the middle of the forest?’ He said, ‘Have you seen any stag?’ ‘Yes,’ replied the old woman, ‘I know the stag,’ and a little dog that had come out of the house with her barked at the man fiercely. ‘Will you be quiet, you wicked toad,’ said he, ‘otherwise I’ll shoot you dead.’ Then the witch shouted angrily, ‘What, my little dog wants to be killed!’ and immediately turned him into a stone, and his bride waited for him in vain, thinking, ‘It’s certainly happened what I was so afraid of and had such a heavy heart about.’

But at home, the other brother was standing by the golden lilies when one of them suddenly fell. ‘Oh God,’ said he, ‘my brother has had a great misfortune; I must go and try to rescue him.’ Then the father said, ‘Stay here, even if I lose you; what shall I do?’ But he replied, ‘I must and will go.’ So he got on his golden horse and rode off and came to the large forest, where his brother lay as a stone. The old witch came out of her house and called him and wanted to turn him into a stone too, but he didn’t approach her; instead, he said, ‘I’ll shoot you dead if you don’t make my brother alive again.’ She was reluctant to do it, but she did it anyway, and the stone became a living man again. The two golden children were overjoyed to see each other again, kissed and hugged each other, and rode off together from the forest, one to his bride, the other back to his father. Then the father said, ‘I knew well that you had rescued your brother, for the golden lily has suddenly come back to life and continued to bloom.’ Now they lived happily, and it went well for them until the end. The man thought to himself, ‘If I have experienced so much trouble and hardship, I will be careful not to ask again how it happened.’
