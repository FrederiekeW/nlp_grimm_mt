There was a farmer who had a faithful horse that had grown old and could no longer perform any services. The farmer said to him, “I certainly don’t need you anymore, but I think I will do you a favor, if you show me that you are still strong enough to bring me a lion here, I will keep you, but now get out of my stable!” and chased it out into the wide field. The horse was sad and went into the forest to seek some protection from the weather. There, a fox met him and said, “What are you hanging your head and wandering around so sadly?” “Oh,” replied the horse, “Greed and loyalty do not live together in the same house: my master has forgotten what services I have rendered him over many years, and because I am no longer able to plow properly, he wants to give me no more food and has chased me out.” “Without any consolation?” asked the fox. “The consolation was bad, he said that if I were still strong enough to bring him a lion, he would keep me, but he knows well that I am not able to do that.” The fox said, “I will help you, just lie down, stretch out, and don’t move as if you were dead.” The horse did as the fox asked, but the fox went to the lion, which had its lair not far away and said, “There lies a dead horse outside, come and have a nice meal!” The lion came and when they stood by the horse, the fox said, “Here you don’t have to eat according to your pleasure, do you know what? I will tie you to it with my tail, so you can drag it into your lair and eat it in peace.” The lion liked the advice and stood still so that the fox could tie the horse to the lion’s legs with its tail. He tied and fastened everything so well and strongly that it could not be undone with any force. When he had finished his work, he patted the horse on the shoulder and said, “Come on, Schimmel, come on.” Then the horse suddenly sprang up and dragged the lion with it. The lion began to roar so loudly that the birds in the entire forest took flight in fright, but the horse let it roar and dragged it over the field in front of its master’s door. When the master saw this, he had second thoughts and said to the horse, “You shall stay with me and have it good,” and gave it plenty to eat until it died. The fox then went to the horse and said, “You don’t owe me a thing, I have saved your life, and you should know that I am your faithful friend and companion, and if you ever find yourself in trouble again, just call on me.” The horse thanked the fox and said, “You are my faithful friend, and I will not forget you, but if I ever find myself in trouble again, I will call on you, but you should know that I will not put you in danger if I can help it, I will help you, but you should not put yourself in danger.”
