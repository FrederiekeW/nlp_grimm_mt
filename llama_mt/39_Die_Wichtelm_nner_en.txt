First Story

The First Tale
There was once a shoemaker who had become so poor through no fault of his own that he had nothing left but a single piece of leather to make a pair of shoes. Now, in the evening, he cut the leather to make the shoes, and he intended to work on them the next morning. And because he had a good conscience, he went to bed peacefully, prayed to the dear God, and fell asleep. The next morning, after he had said his prayers and was about to sit down to work, the two shoes stood finished on his table. He was amazed and didn't know what to say. He picked up the shoes to take a closer look, and they were so well-made that not a single stitch was wrong, as if it were a masterpiece. Soon, a customer arrived, and because he liked the shoes so much, he paid more than usual for them. The shoemaker was able to buy leather for two pairs of shoes with the money. He cut them in the evening and intended to work on them the next morning with fresh courage, but he didn't need to, because when he got up, they were already finished. And the customers didn't stop coming, and they paid so much money that the shoemaker was able to buy leather for four pairs of shoes. He found the four pairs finished in the morning, and so it went on, whatever he cut in the evening was finished in the morning, so that he soon had a decent income and eventually became a wealthy man. Now, one evening, not long before Christmas, when the man had finished cutting, he spoke to his wife as he was going to bed, "What if we stayed up tonight to see who is helping us so kindly?" The wife agreed, and they lit a candle. Then they hid in the corners of the room, behind the clothes that were hung up, and watched. At midnight, two little, cute, naked elves came in, sat down at the shoemaker's table, took all the cut work to themselves, and began to work with their little fingers so quickly and skillfully that the shoemaker couldn't take his eyes off them. They didn't stop until everything was finished and stood ready on the table, then they quickly ran off.

The next morning, the wife said, "The little men have made us rich, we should show our gratitude. They run around, have nothing on their bodies, and must be freezing. I'll make them little shirts, pants, waistcoats, and underpants, and each of them a pair of socks. And you, make each of them a pair of shoes." The man said, "I'm happy to do that." And in the evening, when they had finished making the clothes, they put them on the table instead of the cut work and hid to watch how the elves would react. At midnight, they came running in and wanted to get to work right away, but when they saw no cut leather, but rather the nice clothes, they were amazed, then they showed great joy. With the greatest speed, they put on the clothes, smoothed them out, and sang

"Are we not boys, smooth and fine?
What shall we be longer shoemakers?"

Then they jumped and danced, and sprang over chairs and benches. Finally, they danced out the door. From then on, they didn't come back, and the shoemaker lived well as long as he lived, and everything he undertook was successful.

Second Story

The Second Tale
Once upon a time, there was a poor servant girl who was diligent and clean, swept the house every day, and threw the rubbish out into a big heap in front of the door. One morning, as she was about to go to work, she found a letter on it, and because she couldn't read, she put the broom in the corner and brought the letter to her mistress. And it was an invitation from the elves, who asked her to christen a child. The girl didn't know what to do, but after much urging, and because they told her that one shouldn't decline such a thing, she agreed. Then three elves came and took her to a hollow mountain, where the little ones lived. Everything was small, but so delicate and beautiful that it can't be described. The midwife lay in a bed of black ebony with pearl buttons, the blankets were embroidered with gold, the cradle was made of ivory, and the bathtub was made of gold. The girl stood as godmother and wanted to go home again, but the elves begged her to stay for three days. She stayed and spent the time in joy and pleasure, and the little ones did everything for her out of love. Finally, she wanted to leave, and they stuffed her pockets full of gold and took her back to the mountain. When she came home, she wanted to start work, took the broom in her hand, and began to sweep. But strange people came out of the house, who asked who she was and what she was doing. It wasn't three days, as she had meant, but seven years she had been with the little elves in the mountain, and her former mistress had died in the meantime.

Third Story

The Third Tale
A mother had her child taken from the cradle by the elves, and a changeling with a thick head and staring eyes was put in its place, who only wanted to eat and drink. In her distress, she went to her neighbor and asked for advice. The neighbor said she should take the changeling to the kitchen, put it on the hearth, make a fire, and cook water in two eggshells: that would make the changeling laugh, and if it laughed, it would be the end of it. The woman did everything the neighbor had said. When she put the eggshells with water over the fire, the thickhead said

"Now I am as old
as the Westerwald,
and have not seen anyone cooking in eggshells."

And it began to laugh. As it laughed, a multitude of elves came, brought the right child, put it on the hearth, and took the changeling away. The mother was happy and thanked her neighbor.

Fourth Story

The Fourth Tale
One day, a man came to an old woman who had been carried on his arm by a woman's tooth, and he asked for her advice. She said to him, "You should hang yourself from a tree and beat yourself around the arm, and if you weep, you will be healed." The man did everything the old woman had said, and when he beat himself around the arm, he wept bitterly. Soon, an old woman came and asked him what was wrong, and he told her what had happened to him. She said to him, "I don't know if I can help you, but I'll try." She took him with her, led him into a dark room, and sat him on a stool. She took a woman's tooth, a piece of soap, and a piece of leather, and began to cut. She cut the leather into a piece that she tied around his arm, the soap into a piece that she put into his wound, and the woman's tooth into a piece that she put into his mouth. Then she led him into a bright room and showed him a mirror. The man looked at himself and saw that the piece of leather was tied around his arm, the piece of soap was in his wound, and the woman's tooth was in his mouth. He recognized that he had carried the woman's tooth on his arm himself and began to laugh. Then a multitude of elves came, brought the right child, put it on his arm, and took the changeling away.
