A miller had gradually fallen into poverty and had nothing left but his mill and a large apple tree behind it. One day, he went into the forest to gather firewood, where an old man approached him, whom he had never seen before, and said, "What are you tormenting yourself with chopping wood for? I'll make you rich if you promise me what's behind your mill." "What else could it be than my apple tree?" the miller thought, and said, "Yes," and gave it to the stranger. But the old man laughed scornfully and said, "In three years, I'll come and collect what belongs to me," and left. When the miller returned home, his wife confronted him and said, "Tell me, miller, where did the sudden wealth in our house come from? All at once, all the chests and chests are full, and no one has brought anything in, and I don't know how it happened." He replied, "It comes from a stranger I met in the forest who promised me great riches; I gave him what's behind the mill: the large apple tree, we can certainly give that up." "Oh, man," said the wife, shocked, "that's the devil: he didn't mean the apple tree, but our daughter, who was standing behind the mill and was tending to the farm."

The miller's daughter was a beautiful and pious girl, and lived for three years in fear of God and without sin. When the time was up and the day came when the devil wanted to collect her, she washed herself clean and made a wreath of chalk around herself. The devil appeared early, but he couldn't get close to her. Angry, he spoke to the miller, "Make sure to remove all the water, so she can't wash herself anymore, or else I'll have no power over her." The miller was afraid and did it. The next morning, the devil came again, but she had cried on her hands, and they were completely clean. Again, he couldn't get close to her and spoke angrily to the miller, "Cut off her hands, or I'll have no power over her." The miller was horrified and replied, "How can I cut off my own child's hands?" The devil threatened him and said, "If you don't do it, then you'll be mine, and I'll take you myself." The father was afraid, and he promised to obey him. Then he went to the girl and said, "My child, if I don't cut off both your hands, the devil will take me, and in my fear, I've promised him. Help me in my distress and forgive me for what I'm about to do to you." She replied, "Dear father, do with me as you please, I'm your child." Then he placed both her hands on the table and had them cut off. The devil came for the third time, but she had cried so long and so much on the stumps that they were completely clean. Then he had to retreat and lost all his rights to her.

The miller spoke to her, "I've gained such great wealth through you, I'll keep you in the most luxurious way for the rest of your life." But she replied, "I can't stay here; I want to leave: compassionate people will surely give me as much as I need." Then she had her maimed arms bound to her back, and with the sunrise, she set out and traveled all day until night fell. She came to a royal garden, and under the moonlight, she saw that the trees were full of beautiful fruits, but she couldn't get in, because there was a moat around it. And because she had traveled all day and hadn't eaten a bite, and her hunger was tormenting her, she thought, "Oh, if I were in there, I could eat some of the fruits, otherwise I'll starve to death." Then she knelt down, called out to God, and prayed. Suddenly, an angel appeared, who made a bridge in the water, so that the moat dried up and she could cross it. Then she went into the garden, and the angel went with her. She saw a tree with fruit, which were beautiful pears, but they were all counted. Then she approached and ate one with her mouth from the tree to satisfy her hunger, but not more. The gardener saw it, but because the angel was standing there, he was afraid and thought the girl was a ghost, kept quiet, and didn't dare to call out or speak to the ghost. When she had eaten the pear, she was satisfied, and hid herself in the bushes. The king, who owned the garden, came down the next morning, counted, and saw that one of the pears was missing, and asked the gardener where it had gone: it wasn't under the tree, and it was gone. The gardener replied, "Last night, a ghost came in, who had no hands and ate one with his mouth." The king said, "How did the ghost get over the water, and where did it go after eating the pear?" The gardener replied, "Someone in white clothes came from heaven, who made the bridge and stopped the water, so the ghost could cross the moat. And because it must have been an angel, I was afraid, didn't ask, and didn't call out. When the ghost ate the pear, it went back again." The king said, "If it's as you say, then I want to stay here tonight."

When it grew dark, the king came into the garden, and brought a priest with him, who was supposed to address the ghost. All three sat under the tree and kept watch. At midnight, the girl came out of the bushes, approached the tree, and ate another pear with her mouth; beside her stood the angel in white clothes. Then the priest stepped forward and said, "Are you from God or from the world? Are you a ghost or a human?" She replied, "I'm not a ghost, but a poor human, abandoned by all, but not by God." The king said, "If you're abandoned by all the world, then I won't abandon you." He took her with him to his royal palace, and because she was so beautiful and pious, he loved her deeply, had silver hands made for her, and took her as his queen.

After a year, the king had to go to war, and he ordered his mother to take care of the young queen and said, "If she goes into labor, take care of her and feed her well, and write me a letter about it." Now she gave birth to a beautiful son. Then the old mother wrote a letter quickly and informed him of the happy news. The messenger, however, rested at a stream and fell asleep. Then the devil, who always tried to harm the pious queen, came and exchanged the letter with another one, which said that the queen had given birth to a changeling. When the king read the letter, he was shocked and saddened, but he wrote back, saying that they should take care of the queen and her child until his return. The messenger went back with the letter, rested at the same place, and fell asleep again. Then the devil came again and put another letter in the messenger's bag, which said that they should kill the queen and her child. The old mother was horrified when she received the letter and couldn't believe it, and she wrote to the king again, but she received no other answer, because the devil had always given the messenger a false letter. In the last letter, it was also written to cut off the queen's tongue and eyes as a sign. But the old mother wept that innocent blood was to be shed, took a deer in secret, cut out its tongue and eyes, and lifted them up. Then she spoke to the queen, "I won't let you be killed as the king has ordered, but you can't stay here any longer: go with your child into the wide world and never come back." She bound the child to her back, and the poor woman left with tearful eyes. She came to a large, wild forest, sat on her knees, and prayed to God. The angel of the Lord appeared to her and led her to a small house, which had a sign on it that said, "Here lives everyone freely." From the house came a white maiden, who said, "Welcome, Queen," and led her inside. There, she untied the child from her back, held it to her breast, so it could drink, and then laid it on a beautifully made bed. Then she said to the poor woman, "How do you know that I'm a queen?" The white maiden replied, "I'm an angel, sent by God to care for you and your child." She stayed in the house for seven years and was well taken care of, and through God's mercy, due to her piety, her maimed hands grew back.

The king finally returned from the war and his first thought was to see his wife and child. But the old mother began to weep and said, "You wicked man, what have you written to me that I should kill two innocent souls?" and showed him the two letters that the devil had forged, and said further, "I did as you ordered," and pointed to the signs, tongue and eyes. The king was even more bitterly grieved over his poor wife and child, and the old mother was moved by pity, and spoke to him, "Be content, she lives. I secretly had a deer slaughtered and took the signs from it, your wife's child I had bound to her back, and sent her into the wide world, and she promised to never come back here, because you were so angry with her." The king said, "I'll go as far as the sky is blue, and not eat or drink until I've found my beloved wife and child again, if they haven't starved to death or died of hunger in the meantime."

Then the king set out, traveling for seven years, and searched for them in all the rocky cliffs and rocky caves, but he couldn't find them and thought they had starved to death. He didn't eat or drink during this entire time, but God sustained him. Finally, he came to a large forest and found the small house, which had a sign on it that said, "Here lives everyone freely." Then the white maiden came out, took him by the hand, led him inside, and said, "Welcome, King." She asked him where he came from. He replied, "I've been traveling for seven years, searching for my wife and child, but I couldn't find them, and I thought they had starved to death." The angel offered him food and drink, but he didn't take it, and only wanted to rest. Then he lay down and covered his face with a cloth. After that, the angel went into the room where the queen and her child sat, whom she usually called Schmerzenreich, and said, "Come out with your child, your husband has come." Then she went out where he lay, and the cloth fell off his face. She said, "Schmerzenreich, lift your father's cloth off his face and cover it again." The child lifted it off and covered it again. The king heard this in his sleep and let the cloth fall off again. Then the child grew impatient and said, "Dear mother, how can I cover my father's face, I don't know any father in the world? I've learned to pray, our Father, who is in heaven, you said that our Father was in heaven and was the loving God: how can I know a wild man like that as my father?" When the king heard this, he sat up and asked who she was. She replied, "I'm your wife, and that's your son Schmerzenreich." And he saw her living hands and said, "My wife had silver hands." She replied, "The natural hands have grown back on me, thanks to the merciful God." Then the angel went into the room, brought the silver hands, and showed them to him. Then he saw for sure that it was his beloved wife and child, and he kissed her and was happy, and said, "A heavy stone has fallen from my heart." Then the angel served them food and drink again, and they went home to the old mother. There was great joy everywhere, and the king and queen had a second wedding, and they lived happily until their blessed end. And the king said, "Thus God has given me back my beloved wife and child, and I thank him from the bottom of my heart."
