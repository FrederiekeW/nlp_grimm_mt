In times past, there was a tailor who had three sons and only one goat. But the goat, because it had to feed them all with its milk, had to have good food and be taken out to pasture every day. The sons would take turns doing this. One day, the eldest son took the goat to the churchyard, where the most beautiful herbs grew, and let it eat and run around. In the evening, when it was time to go home, he asked, “Goat, are you full?” The goat replied,

“I am so full,
I don’t want a leaf: meh! meh!”

“So come home,” said the young man, took hold of it by the halter, led it into the stall, and tied it up. “Now,” said the old tailor, “has the goat had its proper food?” “Oh,” replied the son, “it is so full, it doesn’t want a leaf.” The father, however, wanted to convince himself, went down into the stall, stroked the dear animal, and asked, “Goat, are you also full?” The goat replied,

“What should I be full of?
I only jumped over little holes,
and found not a single little leaf: meh! meh!”

“What am I hearing!” cried the tailor, ran upstairs, and spoke to the young man, “Oh, you liar, you say the goat is full, and have left it to starve?” and in his anger, took the ell from the wall and chased him out with blows.

The next day, it was the turn of the second son, who searched for a place at the garden fence where there were many good herbs, and the goat ate them all up. In the evening, when he wanted to go home, he asked, “Goat, are you full?” The goat replied,

“I am so full,
I don’t want a leaf: meh! meh!”

“So come home,” said the young man, led it home, and tied it up in the stall. “Now,” said the old tailor, “has the goat had its proper food?” “Oh,” replied the son, “it is so full, it doesn’t want a leaf.” The tailor did not want to rely on this, went down into the stall, and asked, “Goat, are you also full?” The goat replied,

“What should I be full of?
I only jumped over little holes,
and found not a single little leaf: meh! meh!”

“The wicked scoundrel!” shouted the tailor, “to let such a gentle creature starve!” ran upstairs, and beat the young man out the door with the ell.

It was now the turn of the third son, who wanted to make up for it, searched for bushy branches with the most beautiful foliage, and let the goat eat from them. In the evening, when he wanted to go home, he asked, “Goat, are you also full?” The goat replied,

“I am so full,
I don’t want a leaf: meh! meh!”

“So come home,” said the young man, led it into the stall, and tied it up. “Now,” said the old tailor, “has the goat had its proper food?” “Oh,” replied the son, “it is so full, it doesn’t want a leaf.” The tailor did not trust it, went down into the stall, and asked, “Goat, are you also full?” The goat replied,

“What should I be full of?
I only jumped over little holes,
and found not a single little leaf: meh! meh!”

“Oh, you deceitful brood!” cried the tailor, “one as wicked and neglectful as the other! You should not make a fool of me any longer!” and, in his rage, ran upstairs and scolded the young man with the ell, beating him so severely that he sprang out the door.

The old tailor was now alone with his goat. The next morning, he went down into the stall, stroked the goat, and said, “Come, my dear little creature, I will take you out to pasture myself.” He took it by the halter and brought it to green hedges and under a willow tree and what else goats like to eat. “There, you can satisfy yourself as you please,” he said to it, and let it graze until evening. Then he asked, “Goat, are you full?” The goat replied,

“I am so full,
I don’t want a leaf: meh! meh!”

“So come home,” said the tailor, led it into the stall, and tied it up. As he left, he turned around and said, “Now you are finally full!” But the goat did not make it any better and cried,

“What should I be full of?
I only jumped over little holes,
and found not a single little leaf: meh! meh!”

When the tailor heard this, he was taken aback and saw that he had unjustly cast out his three sons. “Wait,” he cried, “you ungrateful creature, you will not be spared; I will punish you so that you will not be seen among respectable tailors again.” In a rage, he ran upstairs, took out his razor, and shaved the goat’s head so smooth that it was like his flat hand. And because the ell was too dignified, he took the whip and gave it such heavy blows that it ran off in great leaps.

The tailor, now alone in his house, fell into great sorrow and would have liked to have his sons back, but no one knew where they had gone. The eldest son had gone to a cabinetmaker to learn the trade, where he worked diligently and uncomplainingly. When his time was up and he was to leave, the master gave him a small table, which was not particularly impressive and made of ordinary wood. But it had a special property. If you placed it and said, “Table, cover yourself,” the table would suddenly be covered with a clean cloth, and a plate, and a knife and fork would be placed beside it, and bowls with cooked and roasted food, as much as there was room for, and a large glass of red wine would shine so brightly that it would make your heart laugh. The young apprentice thought, “That will be enough for your lifetime,” and set out into the world with a good heart, not worrying about whether a tavern had good food or not, or whether there was anything to be found there or not. If he liked it, he would not even enter the tavern, but in the field, in the forest, on a meadow, where he pleased, he would take his table from his back, place it before him, and say, “Cover yourself,” and everything he desired would be there.

Finally, it occurred to him to return to his father, thinking that his anger would have subsided, and with the table, cover yourself, he would gladly take him back. It happened that he arrived at the tavern on his way home in the evening, which was filled with guests. They welcomed him and invited him to join them and eat with them, otherwise he would hardly get anything. “No,” replied the cabinetmaker, “I won’t take those few bites from you; rather, you should be my guests.” They laughed and thought he was joking with them. But he took his wooden table and placed it in the middle of the room and said, “Table, cover yourself.” Instantly, it was covered with food, as if the tavern owner had brought it in from the kitchen. The guests, as they saw what was meant, did not need to be asked twice, and they approached the table, drew their knives, and eagerly began to eat. And what surprised them most was that whenever a bowl was empty, a full one would immediately take its place. The tavern owner stood in a corner and watched the scene, not knowing what to say, thinking, “You could use a cook like that in your tavern.” The cabinetmaker and his companions were merry until late into the night, finally went to bed, and the young apprentice also went to bed and placed his table against the wall.

But the tavern owner could not sleep, thinking about the old table in his storage room that looked just like it. He took it out and replaced it with the apprentice’s table. The next morning, the apprentice paid his bill, packed his table, and left without noticing that he had a fake one. He arrived at his father’s house in the afternoon, who welcomed him with great joy. “Well, my dear son, what have you learned?” he asked. “Father, I have become a cabinetmaker,” he replied. “A good trade,” said the old tailor, “but what did you bring back from your travels?” “Father, the best thing I brought back is the table,” he said. The tailor looked at it from all sides and said, “You haven’t made a masterpiece of that, that’s an old and poor table.” “But it has the property of covering itself,” replied the son, “when I place it and say, ‘Cover yourself,’ then the most beautiful dishes are immediately placed on it, and a glass of wine that makes the heart happy.” The tailor did not believe it, brought the relatives together, and said, “Let’s have a feast, and I’ll show you what a wonderful table it is.” So the son placed his table in the middle of the room and said, “Table, cover yourself.” But the table did not respond, and remained as empty as any other table that did not understand the language. The poor apprentice realized that his table had been replaced and felt ashamed to stand there like a liar. The relatives laughed at him, and he had to leave without being fed or drunk, just as he had come.

The old tailor took up his needle and thread, and the son went to work for another cabinetmaker.

The second son had gone to a miller to learn the trade, and after he had finished his apprenticeship, the master said, “Since you have behaved so well, I will give you a special donkey, which will not pull a cart and will not carry sacks.” “What is it good for, then?” asked the young apprentice. “It spits gold,” replied the miller, “when you place it on a cloth and say, ‘Bricklebrit,’ then the good animal will spit out gold coins, front and back.” “That’s a wonderful thing,” said the apprentice, thanked the master, and set out into the world. Whenever he needed gold, he would say, “Bricklebrit,” and gold coins would rain down, and he would only have to collect them from the ground. Wherever he went, he was content with the best, and the more expensive the better, for he always had a full purse. After a while, he thought, “You must visit your father, and with the gold donkey, he will forget his anger and take you in.” It happened that he arrived at the same tavern where his brother had been deceived by the table and the gold donkey. He led his donkey by the hand, and the tavern owner wanted to take the animal from him and tie it up, but the young apprentice said, “Don’t bother, I’ll take care of it myself, and I want to know where it is.” The tavern owner thought this was strange and thought that someone who had to take care of their own donkey must not have much to eat. But when the stranger took out two gold coins and said, “Buy something good for me,” the tavern owner’s eyes widened, and he ran to get the best he could find. After dinner, the guest asked what he owed, and the tavern owner wanted to charge him double. The apprentice reached into his pocket, but his gold was gone. “Wait a moment, sir,” he said, “I’ll just go and get some gold.” But he took the tablecloth with him. The tavern owner followed him, curious, and when the guest locked the stable door, the tavern owner looked through a knothole. The stranger spread out the cloth under the donkey, said, “Bricklebrit,” and immediately the donkey began to spit out gold coins, front and back, so that they fell to the ground. “Oh, what a wonderful thing!” exclaimed the tavern owner, “that’s a treasure trove! You could mint coins from it!” The guest paid his bill and went to bed, but the tavern owner sneaked down to the stable and exchanged the donkey with a different one. The next morning, the apprentice left early, thinking he had his gold donkey, but it was not. He arrived at his father’s house in the afternoon, who welcomed him with joy. “What happened to you, my son?” asked the old tailor. “I became a miller,” he replied. “What did you bring back from your travels?” “Just a donkey,” he said. “Donkeys are plentiful here,” said the father, “I would have preferred a good goat.” “But this is no ordinary donkey,” said the son, “it spits gold, and when I say, ‘Bricklebrit,’ it spits out a whole cloth full of gold coins.” The old tailor was skeptical, but the son was convinced that he had brought back a gold-spitting donkey. He invited all the relatives to come, and the son said, “Let’s have a feast, and I’ll show you what a wonderful donkey it is.” So he brought the donkey into the room and said, “Now, brother, speak to it.” The brother said, “Bricklebrit,” but nothing happened, and the donkey did not spit out any gold coins. The poor son realized that he had been deceived and that the tavern owner had exchanged his donkey with a different one. He apologized to the relatives and had to leave without being fed or drunk, just as he had come.

The old tailor took up his needle and thread again, and the son went to work for another miller.

The third son had gone to a turner to learn the trade, and since it was a skilled craft, he had to learn for a long time. His brothers had written to him that they had been deceived by the tavern owner and that he had taken their wonderful wishes away from them. When the turner had finished his apprenticeship and was about to leave, his master said, “Since you have behaved so well, I will give you a sack, and it contains a club.” “I can wear the sack, and it will do me good service, but what’s the club for? It will only make it harder for me.” “That’s what I want to tell you,” replied the master, “if someone has done you harm, just say, ‘Club, out of the sack,’ and the club will jump out and dance on the person’s back, making them unable to move or stir for eight days, and they won’t stop until you say, ‘Club, back in the sack.’” The apprentice thanked him, put on the sack, and whenever someone approached him and wanted to touch him, he would say, “Club, out of the sack,” and the club would jump out and beat them on the back, not waiting for them to take off their clothes. It happened so quickly that the next person in line was already being beaten before the previous one had time to react.

The young turner arrived at the tavern on the evening of his arrival, where his brothers had been deceived. He placed his bag in front of him on the table and began to tell the story of all the strange things he had seen in the world. “Yes,” he said, “you can find a table that covers itself, a gold donkey, and such things: all good things, but nothing compared to the treasure I have acquired and brought with me in my sack.” The tavern owner pricked up his ears: “What in the world could that be?” he thought, “the sack is probably filled with precious stones; I should have that too, for all good things come in threes.” When it was time to go to bed, the guest stretched out on the bench and placed his sack as a pillow under his head. The tavern owner, thinking the guest was fast asleep, went over to him, carefully and quietly pulled on the sack, trying to take it away and replace it with another one. But the turner had been waiting for this moment, and when the tavern owner tried to pull the sack away, he cried, “Club, out of the sack!” and the club jumped out of the sack and hit the tavern owner on the back, beating him so severely that he eventually collapsed to the ground. The turner said, “Since you didn’t return the table and the gold donkey, the dance will continue.” The tavern owner, in a faint voice, begged for mercy, but the turner said, “I will show you mercy, but be careful not to cause harm!”

He then said, “Club, back in the sack,” and the club returned to its place. The turner left the next morning with the table and the gold donkey, and arrived at his father’s house. The old tailor welcomed him with joy and asked, “What have you learned in the world?” “Father, I have become a turner,” he replied. “A skilled trade,” said the father, “what did you bring back from your travels?” “A precious treasure, dear father,” he said, “a club in the sack.” “What?” exclaimed the father, “a club! That’s worth the trouble! You can get one from any tree.” “But this is no ordinary club,” said the son, “when I say, ‘Club, out of the sack,’ it jumps out and makes the person who doesn’t treat me well dance on their back, and they don’t stop until they’re lying on the ground and begging for mercy.” The old tailor was skeptical, but the son was convinced that he had brought back a magical club. He invited all the relatives to come, and the son said, “Let’s have a feast, and I’ll show you what a wonderful club it is.” So he brought the club out of the sack and said, “Now, brother, speak to it.” The brother said, “Club, out of the sack,” and the club jumped out and began to dance on the tavern owner’s back, making him dance until he was exhausted. Then the turner said, “Club, back in the sack,” and the club returned to its place. The relatives were amazed, and the old tailor was overjoyed to see his sons reunited with their wonderful treasures. He locked up his needle and thread, his ell, and his iron in a chest and lived with his three sons in joy and prosperity.

But what happened to the goat that was to blame for the tailor’s misfortune? I will tell you. It was ashamed of its bald head and ran into a fox’s den and hid itself. When the fox came home, a pair of big eyes glowed out of the darkness, scaring him and making him run back home. The bear met him and asked, “What’s wrong, dear fox? What’s wrong with your face?” “Oh,” replied the fox, “a fierce animal is sitting in my den, and it’s staring at me with fiery eyes.” “We’ll get rid of it,” said the bear, went with the fox to the den, and looked inside. But when they saw the fiery eyes, they were also frightened and didn’t want to have anything to do with the fierce creature and ran away. The bee met them and asked, “Bear, you look very upset. Where has your joy gone?” “You have a good laugh,” replied the bear, “but there’s a fierce animal with glowing eyes sitting in the fox’s den, and we can’t get rid of it.” The bee said, “You’re teasing me, bear, but I think I can help you.” She flew into the fox’s den, sat on the goat’s bald head, and stung it so severely that it jumped up and shouted, “Meh! Meh!” and ran out of the den, wild and crazy, and no one knows where it ran to. And so the goat was able to get its revenge, since the tailor had cast out his three sons.
