It was once a child, obstinate and not doing what his mother wished. For this, the loving God took no pleasure in him and made him ill, and no doctor could help him, and soon he lay on the deathbed. As he was now buried and earth was laid over him, suddenly his little arm came out and reached up, and when they put it back in and fresh earth was laid on top, it came out again. Then his mother had to go to the grave and strike the little arm with the rod, and as soon as she had done so, it drew back in, and the child had rest under the earth.
