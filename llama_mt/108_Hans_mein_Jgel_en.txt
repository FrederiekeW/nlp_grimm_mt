Once upon a time there was a farmer who had enough money and goods, but like all the wealth he had, he was still missing something from his happiness: he had no children with his wife. Often, when he went into town with the other farmers, they would mock him and ask why he had no children. Finally, he got angry and when he came home, he said, ‘I want a child, and it shall be a boy!’ Then his wife had a child, which was a boy on top and a hedgehog on the bottom, and when she saw the child, she was frightened and said, ‘You see, you have cursed us.’ Then the man said, ‘What can that help, the boy must be baptized, but we can’t choose a godfather for him.’ The wife said, ‘We can’t baptize him any other way than Hans my hedgehog.’ When he was baptized, the priest said, ‘He can’t get into a decent bed because of his spines.’ Then a little straw was made behind the oven and Hans my hedgehog was put on it. He also couldn’t drink from his mother’s breast, because he would have pricked her with his spines. So he lay there behind the oven for eight years, and his father was tired of him and thought, ‘If only he would die!’ But he didn’t die, but stayed there. Now it happened that there was a market in the city, and the farmer wanted to go, so he asked his wife what he should bring her. ‘A little meat and a few loaves of bread, what is needed for the household’ she said. Then he asked the maid, who wanted a few toffels and some striped stockings. Finally, he said, ‘Hans my hedgehog, what do you want?’ ‘Daddy,’ he said, ‘bring me a bagpipe.’ Now, when the farmer came back home, he gave his wife what he had bought for her, meat and bread, then he gave the maid the toffels and the striped stockings, finally he went behind the oven and gave Hans my hedgehog the bagpipe. And when Hans my hedgehog had the bagpipe, he said, ‘Daddy, go to the blacksmith and have my rooster shod, then I want to ride out and never come back.’ The father was happy that he was getting rid of him, and had the rooster shod, and when it was done, Hans my hedgehog sat on it, rode off, took pigs and donkeys with him, which he wanted to guard in the forest. In the forest, the rooster had to fly up with him to a high tree, where he sat and guarded the pigs and donkeys, and sat for many years until the herd was very large, and his father knew nothing of him. When he was sitting on the tree, he blew his bagpipe and made music, which was very beautiful. One day, a king came riding by, who had gotten lost, and heard the music from afar, and was surprised and sent his servant to find out where the music was coming from. The servant looked around, but saw nothing but a small animal sitting on a tree, which was like a rooster, with a hedgehog sitting on it, and it was making the music. Then the king said to the servant, ‘He should ask why he was sitting there, and if he didn’t know where the way to his kingdom was.’ Then Hans my hedgehog got off the tree and said, ‘I will show him the way, if the king wants to promise me and swear to me what he will meet first at the royal court when he gets home.’ The king thought, ‘I can easily do that, Hans my hedgehog doesn’t understand, and I can write whatever I want.’ So the king took a feather and a quill and wrote something, and when it was done, he showed it to Hans my hedgehog, and Hans my hedgehog showed him the way, and the king came home happily. His daughter, however, when she saw him from afar, was so full of joy that she ran to him and kissed him. Then he thought of Hans my hedgehog and told her how it had happened, and that he had promised a strange animal to do what he wanted, and that the animal had ridden on a rooster like a horse, and had made beautiful music, and that he had written that he should not have it, because Hans my hedgehog couldn’t read. The princess was happy and said that was good, because she would never have gone. Hans my hedgehog, however, guarded the pigs and donkeys, and the pigs had pigs again, and the donkeys had donkeys again, and the forest was full of them. Then Hans my hedgehog didn’t want to live in the forest any longer, and had his father say that they should clear out all the stalls in the village, because he was coming with a herd so large that everyone could slaughter as much as they wanted. The father was sad when he heard this, because he thought Hans my hedgehog was already dead. Hans my hedgehog, however, sat on his rooster, drove the pigs in front of him into the village, and let everyone slaughter as much as they wanted. Oh, what a slaughter and what a hacking, that could be heard for two hours! After that, Hans my hedgehog said, ‘Daddy, let me have my rooster shod one more time, then I will ride off and never come back.’ The father had the rooster shod, and was happy that Hans my hedgehog didn’t want to come back. Hans my hedgehog rode off to the first kingdom, where the king had ordered that if someone came riding on a rooster and had a bagpipe with him, then everyone should shoot at him, hack at him, and stab him, so that he wouldn’t get into the castle. When Hans my hedgehog rode up, they attacked him with their bayonets, but he gave the rooster a kick and flew over the gate, right in front of the king’s window, and said, ‘You should give me what you promised, otherwise I will kill you and your daughter.’ The king then gave his daughter good words, and she should go out to him, so that she and she could save their lives. So she put on white clothes, and her father gave her a carriage with six horses and beautiful servants, money and goods. She sat in it, and Hans my hedgehog with his rooster and bagpipe beside her, then they took their leave and rode off, and the king thought he would never see her again. But it didn’t go as he thought, because when they were a little way from the city, Hans my hedgehog took off her beautiful clothes, and pricked her with his hedgehog spines until she was all bloody, and said, ‘This is the reward for your deceit, go, I don’t want you!’ and chased her back home, and she was forever ashamed. Hans my hedgehog, however, rode on his rooster and with his bagpipe to the second kingdom, where he had also shown the king the way. The king had ordered that if someone came like Hans my hedgehog, they should present their guns, let him in freely, shout ‘Vivat!’ and bring him into the royal castle. When Hans my hedgehog rode up, the king’s daughter saw him and was frightened because he looked too strange, but she thought it was not otherwise, because she had promised her father. So Hans my hedgehog was welcomed by her, and he was married to her, and he had to sit at the royal table, and she sat beside him, and they ate and drank. When evening came, they wanted to go to sleep, and she was afraid of his spines, but he said she shouldn’t be afraid, and told the old king to order four men to stand guard in front of their chamber door, and to make a big fire, and when he went into the chamber and wanted to get into bed, he would take off his hedgehog skin and leave it lying in front of the bed, and then the men should quickly run in and throw it into the fire, and stay there until it was burned up. When the clock struck eleven, he went into the chamber, took off his hedgehog skin, and left it lying in front of the bed, and the men ran in and threw it into the fire, and when it was burned up, he was freed, and lay in bed, completely human in shape, but he was as black as coal. The king sent for his doctor, who washed him with good salves and anointed him, and he became white, and was a handsome young man. When the king’s daughter saw him, she was happy, and the next morning they rode out with joy, ate and drank, and the wedding was celebrated even more, and Hans my hedgehog got the kingdom from the old king.

After many years had passed, he rode with his wife to his father and said he was his son, but the father said he had none, he had only had one, who was born with hedgehog spines, and went into the world. Then he gave himself to know, and the old father was happy and went with him to his kingdom.
