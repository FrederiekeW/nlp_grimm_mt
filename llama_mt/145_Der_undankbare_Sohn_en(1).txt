There was once a man and his wife sitting at the door of their house, with a roasted chicken before them, and they were eager to share it. But the man saw his father approaching, and, without a word, snatched up the chicken and hid it. His father arrived, took a drink, and went off. The son, thinking he'd be rid of the old man, reached for the chicken to put it back on the table. But as he did, it had turned into a monstrous toad, which sprang into his face and wouldn't budge. If anyone tried to shoo it away, the toad would fix them with a venomous stare, as if it meant to leap right into their face. No one dared to touch it. And so the son was forced to feed this wretched creature every day, or else it would devour his very face. And thus he went about the world, never at peace.
