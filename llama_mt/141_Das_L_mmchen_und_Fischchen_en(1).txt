There was once a brother and sister who loved each other dearly. Their mother had long since passed away, and they had a stepmother who was not good to them and secretly caused them all sorts of harm. It happened that the two were playing with other children on a meadow in front of the house, and there was a pond that ran up to the side of the house. The children ran around, chasing each other and playing a counting game:

‘Eneke, Beneke, let me love you,
I want to give you my little birds.
The birds will search for the straw,
The straw will give me the goat,
The goat will give me milk,
The milk will give me to the baker,
The baker will bake me a cake,
The cake will give me to the cat,
The cat will catch me mice,
The mice will hang in the rafter
and I will skin them.’

As they stood in a circle, the word ‘skin them’ was spoken, and the one who had spoken it had to run away, and the others chased after him. As they ran and played, the stepmother watched from the window and grew angry. But since she was skilled in witchcraft, she cursed the two, turning the brother into a fish and the sister into a lamb. The fish swam back and forth in the pond, and was sad, while the lamb wandered around on the meadow, and was sad and wouldn’t eat or move a single blade of grass. This went on for a long time, until some foreign guests came to the castle. The stepmother thought, “Now is a good opportunity,” and called out to the cook, “Go and fetch the lamb from the meadow and slaughter it, we have nothing else for the guests.” The cook went and fetched the lamb and led it into the kitchen, and tied its little legs. The lamb endured all of this patiently. When the cook had pulled out his knife and was sharpening it on the threshold, ready to slaughter it, the lamb looked up and saw a little fish swimming in the water in front of the castle and looking up at it. This was the brother, for when the fish had seen the cook leading the lamb away, it had swum to the castle in the pond. The lamb cried out:

‘Oh, brother, in the deep sea,
how my heart is aching!
The cook is sharpening his knife,
and wants to pierce my heart.’

The fish replied:

‘Oh, sister, in the high meadow,
how my heart is aching!
In this deep sea, I am so sorrowful.’

When the cook heard the lamb speak and say such sad words to the fish, he was frightened and thought that it must not be a natural lamb, but one that had been cursed by the wicked woman in the house. He said, “Be quiet, I won’t slaughter you,” and took another animal and prepared it for the guests, and brought the lamb to a good peasant woman, telling her everything he had seen and heard. The peasant woman was the one who had been the sister’s nurse, and immediately suspected who it might be, and went with the lamb to a wise woman. The wise woman blessed the lamb and the fish, and they regained their human form, and then led them to a large forest and a small cottage, where they lived alone, but happily and contentedly.
