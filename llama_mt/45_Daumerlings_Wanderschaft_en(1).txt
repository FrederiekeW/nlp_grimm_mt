A tailor had a son, who was small in stature and no bigger than a thumb, so he was called the Daumerling. But he had courage in his heart and said to his father, "Father, I must go out into the world." "Very well, my son," said the old man, took a long sewing needle and tied a knot of sealing wax to the end of it, "there you have a sword to take with you." Now the little tailor wanted to have one more meal, and he hopped into the kitchen to see what his mother had cooked. It was just ready, and the dish was on the stove. Then he said, "Mother, what's for dinner?" "Look for yourself," said the mother. Then the Daumerling sprang onto the stove and looked into the dish: because he stretched his neck too far, the steam from the food caught him and blew him out the chimney. For a while he rode the steam in the air, until he finally fell back down to the ground. Now the little tailor was out in the wide world, wandered around, and also worked for a master, but the food was not good enough for him. "Mrs. Master, if you don't give us better food," said the Daumerling, "I'll go away and tomorrow morning I'll write on your door with chalk: 'Too many potatoes, too little meat, Adieu, King Potato'." "What do you want, Grasshopper?" said the mistress, got angry, took a cloth and wanted to hit him: my little tailor quickly crawled under the finger bowl, looked out and stuck his tongue out at the mistress. She picked up the finger bowl and wanted to catch him, but the little Daumerling hopped into the cloth, and when the mistress threw the cloth apart and looked for him, he hid in the tablecloth. "Hey, hey, Mrs. Mistress," he called out and stuck his head up, and when she wanted to hit him, he jumped into the drawer. Finally, she caught him and chased him out of the house.

The little tailor wandered and came into a great forest: there he met a group of robbers who wanted to steal the king's treasure. When they saw the little tailor, they thought, "such a small boy can crawl through a keyhole and serve us as a locksmith." "Hey," called one of them, "you giant Goliath, do you want to go to the treasure chamber with us? You can sneak in and throw the money out." The Daumerling thought about it, and finally said, "yes" and went with them to the treasure chamber. There, he looked at the door above and below to see if there was any crack in it. Not long after, he discovered one that was wide enough for him to squeeze through. He wanted to go through right away, but one of the two sentries who stood in front of the door noticed him and said to the other, "what kind of ugly spider is crawling around? I'll kill it." "Leave it alone," said the other, "it hasn't done us any harm." Now the Daumerling slipped through the crack into the treasure chamber, opened the window under which the robbers were standing, and threw coins one after another out the window. When the Daumerling was in the best work, he heard the king coming, who wanted to see his treasure chamber, and he quickly hid. The king noticed that many hard coins were missing, but he couldn't understand who had stolen them, since the locks and bolts were in good condition, and everything seemed to be well guarded. So he went away and said to the two sentries, "be careful, there is a thief among the money." When the Daumerling now started working again, he heard the money inside clinking and clattering, and the two sentries heard it too and jumped in to catch the thief. But the little Daumerling, who heard them coming, was even faster, sprang into a corner and covered a coin with himself, so that nothing of him was visible, and he even teased the sentries and called out, "here I am." The sentries ran to the spot, but when they arrived, he was already in another corner, and called out, "here I am." The sentries ran to the spot, but when they arrived, he was already in a third corner, and called out, "here I am." And so he led them on a wild goose chase through the treasure chamber until they were tired and went away. Now the Daumerling threw the coins one by one out the window: with all his might, he threw the last one, hopped onto it, and flew with it out the window. The robbers praised him highly, "you are a mighty hero," they said, "do you want to be our leader?" The Daumerling thanked them, but said he wanted to see the world first. They divided the loot, but the Daumerling only asked for a kreuzer, because he couldn't carry any more.

Then he buckled his sword around his waist, said goodbye to the robbers, and took the road between the legs. He worked for some masters, but the food was not good enough for him. Finally, he was hired as a house servant at an inn. The maids, however, could not stand him, because without seeing him, he saw everything they did in secret, and reported it to the mistress. So they said, "wait, we'll get even with him," and planned to play a trick on him. When one of the maids was mowing the garden a little later, and saw the Daumerling hopping around and crawling on the herbs, she quickly mowed him up with the grass, wrapped everything in a large cloth, and threw it secretly to the cows. Now there was a big black one under it, which swallowed him down without harming him. Down below, however, it felt bad, because it was very dark and there was no light. When the cow was milked, the Daumerling cried out, "strip, strap, stroll, is the pail full yet?" But the sound of the milking was so loud that no one understood him. Later, the master came into the stable and said, "tomorrow the cow will be slaughtered." The Daumerling was afraid and cried out in a loud voice, "let me out, I'm stuck in here." The master heard it, but didn't know where the voice came from. "Where are you?" he asked. "In the black one," replied the Daumerling, but the master didn't understand what he meant and went away.

The next morning, the cow was slaughtered. Luckily, the Daumerling was not hit by any of the blows, but he got stuck under the sausage meat. When the butcher came in and started working, the Daumerling shouted at the top of his lungs, "don't cut too deep, don't cut too deep, I'm stuck underneath!" But no one heard him over the noise of the knives. Now the poor Daumerling was in a tight spot, but necessity makes one clever, and he sprang so quickly between the knives that none of them touched him, and he escaped with his life. But he couldn't get out either: there was no other way, he had to be stuffed into a blood sausage with the sausage meat. It was a tight fit, and to make matters worse, he was hung in the chimney to be smoked. Time seemed to drag on endlessly, and finally, in the winter, he was taken down because the sausage was to be served to a guest. When the innkeeper's wife cut the sausage into slices, the Daumerling kept a close eye on himself, not to stretch his head too far out, so that it wouldn't be cut off. Finally, he saw his chance and sprang out.

In the house where he had had such a bad time, the Daumerling did not want to stay any longer, but set out on his travels again. But his freedom was short-lived. On an open field, he met a fox, who snapped him up in his thoughts. "Ah, Mr. Fox," said the Daumerling, "I'm the one stuck in your throat, let me out." "You're right," replied the fox, "I have nothing but you; promise me the chickens in your father's yard, and I'll let you go." "I promise you from the heart," said the Daumerling, "you can have all the chickens you want." The fox let him go and took him home. When the father saw his beloved son again, he gave the fox all the chickens he had. "As a thank you, I'll bring you a nice piece of money," said the Daumerling and handed the fox a kreuzer he had earned on his travels.

"Why did the fox get the poor chicken to eat, though?" "Oh, you fool, your father will surely love his child more than the chickens on the farm." "But," said the fox, "we don't have any chickens on the farm, the chickens have us." "Yes," said the father, "that's true." And the fox was satisfied with the answer.

The Daumerling was welcomed back home and stayed in the tailor's shop with his father. One day, the king visited the tailor's shop and saw the little Daumerling sitting on a stool, and said to him, "you are a true hero, having experienced so many adventures. What do you want?" The Daumerling said, "I want Father to make me a pair of pants, so I don't have to go out into the world again." The father was happy to have his son back and made him a pair of pants that fit him perfectly, so he never went out again. And the Daumerling lived happily with his father.
