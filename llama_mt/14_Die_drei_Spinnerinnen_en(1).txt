It was a girl who was idle and did not want to spin, and her mother could not say what she wanted, she could not get her to do it. Finally, the mother took a turn of anger and impatience, and she hit her, whereupon it began to cry loudly. Now, the queen was just passing by, and when she heard the crying, she stopped, stepped into the house, and asked the mother why she was beating her daughter so that one could hear the screaming from the street. Then the woman was ashamed to reveal the laziness of her daughter and said, ‘I can’t get her to stop spinning, she always and forever wants to spin, and I am poor and can’t get the flax.’ Then the queen said, ‘I hear nothing more pleasant than spinning, and I am not happier than when the wheels spin: give me your daughter, I have plenty of flax, there she can spin as much as she wants.’ The mother was heartily pleased and the queen took the girl with her. When they arrived at the castle, she led her up to three chambers that were full from top to bottom with the most beautiful flax. ‘Now spin this flax for me,’ she said, ‘and if you finish it, you shall have my eldest son as your husband; even if you are poor, I don’t care, your untiring diligence is enough provision.’ The girl was inwardly shocked, for she could not spin the flax, and if it were three hundred years old, she would have sat there every day from morning to evening. When she was alone, she began to cry and sat there for three days without moving a hand. On the third day, the queen came and when she saw that nothing had been spun, she was surprised, but the girl excused herself by saying that she had not been able to start because of great sorrow over being away from her mother’s house. The queen let that pass and said as she was leaving, ‘tomorrow you must start working.’ When the girl was alone again, she did not know what to do or how to help herself, and in her distress she went to the window. There she saw three women coming, of whom the first had a broad flat foot, the second had a lower lip so large that it hung down over her chin, and the third had a broad thumb. They stood in front of the window and asked the girl what was wrong. She complained to them of her plight, and they offered her their help and said, ‘If you want to invite us to the wedding, not to be ashamed of us and to call us your aunts, and to seat us at your table, we will take the flax away from you and finish it quickly.’ ‘With all my heart,’ she replied, ‘come in and start working right away.’ So she let the three strange women in and made a hole in the first chamber, where they sat down and started spinning. The one pulled the thread and stepped on the wheel, the other netted the thread, the third turned it and struck the table with her finger, and each time she struck, a bundle of yarn fell to the ground, and it was spun as fine as could be. She hid the three spinning women from the queen and showed her the amount of yarn spun whenever she came, so that the queen was full of praise. When the first chamber was empty, they went to the second, and finally to the third, and that was also quickly cleared. Now the three women took their leave and said to the girl, ‘don’t forget what you promised us, it will be your good fortune.’ When the girl showed the queen the empty chambers and the large heap of yarn, she arranged the wedding, and the bridegroom was overjoyed that he was getting a wife who was so skilled and diligent, and he praised her highly. ‘I have three aunts,’ said the girl, ‘and since they did me a lot of good, I didn’t want to forget them in my happiness: please let me invite them to the wedding and let them sit at the table with me.’ The queen and the bridegroom said, ‘why should we not allow that?’ Now, as the feast began, the three maids entered in a wondrous attire, and the bride said, ‘welcome, dear aunts.’ ‘Ah,’ said the bridegroom, ‘how do you come to have such a strange friendship?’ Then he went to the first woman with the broad flat foot and asked, ‘what is the origin of your broad foot?’ ‘From walking,’ she replied, ‘from walking.’ Then he went to the second and asked, ‘what is the origin of your hanging lower lip?’ ‘From licking,’ she replied, ‘from licking.’ Then he asked the third, ‘what is the origin of your broad thumb?’ ‘From spinning,’ she replied, ‘from spinning.’ Then the prince was shocked and said, ‘so I shall never, never allow my beautiful bride to touch a spinning wheel.’ And so the girl was rid of the evil spinning.
