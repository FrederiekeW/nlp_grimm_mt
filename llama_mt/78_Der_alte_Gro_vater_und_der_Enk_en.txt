There was once an old man who had grown grey and his eyes had become dull, his ears deaf and his knees trembled. When he sat at table and could hardly hold his spoon, he spilled soup onto the tablecloth and some of it even trickled out of his mouth. His son and his son's wife were revolted by this and so the old grandfather was finally forced to sit in the corner behind the oven, and they gave him his food in a little earthenware bowl and not even enough to satisfy him. He looked sorrowfully at the table, and his eyes grew wet. Once his shaky hands were unable to hold the bowl, and it fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed. So she bought him a wooden bowl for a few pennies, and from then on he had to eat out of that. When they sat there like that, the little four-year-old grandson sat on the ground picking up little wooden pieces. "What are you doing?" his father asked. "I'm making a trough," the child replied, "out of which Father and Mother will eat when I grow up." Then the man and his wife looked at each other for a while and finally began to cry. They immediately fetched the old grandfather to the table and from then on let him eat with them, and they said nothing even when he spilled a little.
