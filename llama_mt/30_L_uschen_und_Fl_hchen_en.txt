A little louse and a little flea who lived together in a household and brewed beer in an eggshell. When the little louse fell in and burned itself, the little flea began to scream loudly. Then the little door spoke up, "What are you screaming about, little flea?" "Because the little louse has burned itself."

The door then began to creak. A little broom in the corner spoke up, "What are you creaking about, little door?" "Should I not creak? The little louse has burned itself, the little flea is crying."

The broom then began to sweep with a dreadful noise. A little cart came by and said, "What are you sweeping about, little broom?" "Should I not sweep? The little louse has burned itself, the little flea is crying, the door is creaking."

The cart then said, "So I will run," and began to run with a dreadful speed. A little pile of manure came by and said, "What are you running about, little cart?" "Should I not run? The little louse has burned itself, the little flea is crying, the door is creaking, the broom is sweeping."

The pile of manure then said, "So I will burn," and began to burn with a fierce flame. A little tree stood next to the pile of manure and said, "Manure, why are you burning?" "Should I not burn? The little louse has burned itself, the little flea is crying, the door is creaking, the broom is sweeping, the cart is running."

The tree then said, "So I will shake myself," and began to shake itself so hard that all its leaves fell off. A girl came by with her water jug and said, "Tree, why are you shaking yourself?" "Should I not shake myself? The little louse has burned itself, the little flea is crying, the door is creaking, the broom is sweeping, the cart is running, the manure is burning."

The girl then said, "So I will break my water jug," and broke the water jug. A spring spoke up and said, "Girl, why are you breaking your water jug?" "Should I not break my water jug? The little louse has burned itself, the little flea is crying, the door is creaking, the broom is sweeping, the cart is running, the manure is burning, the tree is shaking itself."

The spring then said, "So I will begin to flow," and began to flow with a dreadful speed. And in the water, everything drowned, the girl, the tree, the manure, the cart, the broom, the door, the flea, the louse, all together. And the eggshell, in which the beer was brewed, is shattered and lies on the ground.
