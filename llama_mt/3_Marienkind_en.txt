In front of a great forest lived a woodcutter with his wife, who had only one child, a three-year-old girl. They were so poor that they did not have enough bread for the day and did not know what to give their child to eat. One morning, the woodcutter, full of worries, went out into the forest to work, and as he was chopping wood, a beautiful large woman appeared before him, who had a crown of shining stars on her head and spoke to him, "I am the Virgin Mary, the mother of the Child: you are poor and destitute, bring me your child, I will take it with me, be its mother and take care of it." The woodcutter obeyed, fetched his child and handed it over to the Virgin Mary, who took it with her up to heaven. It went well for him, he ate sugar bread and drank sweet milk, and his clothes were made of gold, and the angels played with him. As it grew up to fourteen years old, it called the Virgin Mary to it and spoke, "dear child, I have a great journey ahead of me, take the keys to the thirteen doors of the heavenly kingdom in custody: you may open twelve of them and admire the wonders within, but the thirteenth, to which this small key belongs, is forbidden to you: beware that you do not open it, lest you become unhappy." The girl promised to be obedient, and when the Virgin Mary was gone, it began to open the rooms of the heavenly kingdom: every day it opened one, until the twelve were done. In each, however, an apostle sat, surrounded by great glory, and it was delighted by all the splendor and glory, and the angels, who always accompanied it, were delighted with it. Now the forbidden door was left alone, and it felt a great desire to know what was hidden behind it, and spoke to the angels, "I won't open it completely and won't go inside, but I'll open it so that we can take a peek through the crack." "Oh no," said the angels, "that would be a sin: the Virgin Mary has forbidden it, and it could easily become your misfortune." It fell silent, but the desire in its heart did not fall silent, but nagged and picked at it, and gave it no rest. And when the angels were once all gone, it thought, "now I'm all alone and could peek inside, no one would know if I did." It searched for the key and when it had it in its hand, it also put it into the lock, and when it had put it in, it also turned it. Then the door sprang open, and it saw the Trinity sitting in fire and glory. It stood for a while and looked at everything with wonder, then touched a little with its finger the glory, and its finger became golden. At once it felt a tremendous fear, slammed the door shut and ran away. The fear did not subside, it could start anything it wanted, and its heart beat constantly and would not become calm: the gold also remained on its finger and would not come off, no matter how much it washed and rubbed it. Not long after, the Virgin Mary returned from her journey. She called the girl to her and demanded that she return the keys to the heavenly kingdom. When it handed over the bundle, the Virgin Mary looked into its eyes and spoke, "Did you not open the thirteenth door?" "No," it replied. Then she laid her hand on its heart, felt how it beat and beat, and knew that it had broken her command and opened the door. Then she spoke again, "Did you not do it?" "No," it said again. Then she saw the finger of the child, which had become golden from the touch of the heavenly fire, saw that it had sinned and spoke for the third time, "Did you not do it?" "No," it said for the third time. Then the Virgin Mary spoke, "You did not obey me, and you lied, you are no longer worthy to be in heaven."

Then the girl fell into a deep sleep, and when it woke up, it was lying on the ground, in the middle of a wilderness. It wanted to cry out, but it could not make a sound. It sprang up and wanted to run away, but wherever it turned, dense thorn thickets held it back, which it could not break through. In the desolation, in which it was enclosed, stood an old hollow tree, that had to be its home. Then it crawled into it at night, and slept there, and when it stormed and rained, it found shelter there: but it was a wretched life, and when it thought about how it had been so beautiful in heaven, and the angels had played with it, it wept bitterly. Roots and forest berries were its only food, which it sought as far as it could. In the autumn, it collected the fallen nuts and leaves and carried them into the hollow, the nuts were its food in the winter, and when snow and ice came, it crawled into the leaves, so that it did not freeze. Not long after, its clothes fell apart and pieces fell off its body one after the other. As soon as the sun shone warm again, it went out and sat in front of the tree, and its long hair covered it from all sides like a cloak. So it sat year after year, and felt the wretchedness and misery of the world.

One day, when the trees were again green, the king of the land hunted in the forest and chased a deer, and because it had fled into the thicket that surrounded the clearing, he dismounted, tore the undergrowth apart, and hacked his way through with his sword. When he finally got through, he saw a beautiful girl sitting under the tree, who sat there and was covered from her golden hair to her toes. He stood still and looked at her in amazement, then spoke to her and said, "Who are you? Why are you sitting here in the wilderness?" But there was no answer, because it could not open its mouth. The king spoke further, "Do you want to come with me to my castle?" It nodded only a little with its head. The king took it on his arm, put it on his horse, and rode with it home, and when he arrived at the royal castle, he had beautiful clothes put on it and gave it everything in abundance. And although it could not speak, it was beautiful and charming, that he loved it from the heart, and it did not take long before he married it.

About a year later, the queen gave birth to a son. That night, when she was alone in her bed, the Virgin Mary appeared to her and spoke, "Do you want to tell the truth and confess that you opened the forbidden door, I will open your mouth and give you back your speech: if you persist in your sin and lie, I will take your newborn child with me." The queen was unable to answer, she remained stubborn and said, "No, I did not open the forbidden door." The Virgin Mary took the newborn child from her arms and disappeared with it. The next morning, when the child was not to be found, a murmur went through the people, "the queen is a child-eater, she has killed her own child." She heard everything and could not say anything against it, the king, however, did not believe it because he loved her so much.

A year later, the queen gave birth to another son. That night, the Virgin Mary appeared to her again and spoke, "Do you want to confess that you opened the forbidden door, I will give you back your child and loosen your tongue: if you persist in your sin and lie, I will take this newborn child with me." The queen said again, "No, I did not open the forbidden door," and the Virgin Mary took the child from her arms and disappeared with it. The next morning, when the child was again missing, the people shouted loudly, "the queen has eaten the child," and the king's advisors demanded that she be tried. The king, however, loved her so much that he did not believe it and forbade the advisors from speaking about it any further.

The next year, the queen gave birth to a beautiful little daughter. That night, the Virgin Mary appeared to her for the third time and spoke, "Follow me." She took her by the hand and led her to heaven, and showed her her two oldest children, who laughed and played with the world globe. When the queen was happy about this, the Virgin Mary spoke, "Is your heart not yet softened? If you confess that you opened the forbidden door, I will give you back your two sons." But the queen replied for the third time, "No, I did not open the forbidden door." Then the Virgin Mary left her and took the third child with her.

The next morning, when it became known, all the people shouted loudly, "the queen is a child-eater, she must be condemned," and the king could no longer resist his advisors. A trial was held over her, and because she could not answer and defend herself, she was condemned to die on the pyre. The wood was gathered, and when she was tied to a stake and the fire was lit around her, the hard ice of pride melted, and her heart was moved by remorse, and she thought, "if only I could confess before my death that I opened the door," then her voice came out loud, "yes, Mary, I did it!" And immediately the sky began to rain and extinguished the flames, and a light broke out above her, and the Virgin Mary came down and had the two sons by her side and the newborn daughter on her arm. She spoke kindly to her, "whoever repents of their sin and confesses, will have it forgiven," and handed her the three children, loosened her tongue, and gave her happiness for the rest of her life. And the queen thanked her from her heart, and the Virgin Mary took her by the hand and led her to heaven, where she lived with her children.
