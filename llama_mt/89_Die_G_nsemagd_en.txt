Once upon a time, there lived an old queen, whose husband had long since passed away. She had a beautiful daughter, and as the child grew, she was promised to a king's son in marriage. When the time came for the daughter to be married and to depart for the foreign kingdom, the old queen packed her with all sorts of precious items, gold and silver, cups and jewels, and all the other things that belonged to a royal dowry, for she loved her child dearly. She also gave her a chambermaid, who was to ride with her and deliver her into the hands of her bridegroom, and each of them received a horse for the journey, but the horse of the king's daughter was named Falada and could speak. As the hour of departure approached, the old queen went into her bedchamber, took a small knife, and cut her fingers so that they bled, then she took a white cloth and let three drops of blood fall onto it, gave it to her daughter, and said, 'Dear child, take good care of it, for it will bring you trouble on your journey.'

The two of them took a sorrowful farewell, the cloth was placed in the king's daughter's bosom, she mounted her horse, and set off to her bridegroom. As they had been riding for an hour, she felt a great thirst and said to her chambermaid, 'Dismount, and fetch me a drink from the brook with my golden cup, for I would like to drink.' 'If you are thirsty,' replied the chambermaid, 'then dismount yourself and drink, I do not want to be your maid.' The king's daughter dismounted and bent over the water in the brook to drink, and was not allowed to drink from the golden cup. She exclaimed, 'Oh dear God!' and the three drops of blood replied, 'If your mother knew, her heart would break in two.' But the king's daughter was humble, said nothing, and remounted her horse. They rode on for a while longer, but the day was hot, the sun was shining, and she felt thirsty again. As they approached a river, she called out to her chambermaid, 'Dismount and give me a drink from my golden cup.' The chambermaid, however, spoke even more haughtily, 'If you want to drink, then drink yourself, I do not want to be your maid.' The king's daughter dismounted and bent over the water, wept, and exclaimed, 'Oh dear God!' and the three drops of blood replied again, 'If your mother knew, her heart would break in two.' As she bent over the water, the cloth with the three drops of blood fell out of her bosom and flowed away with the water without her noticing. The chambermaid had been watching and was glad that she had gained power over the bride, for with the loss of the three drops of blood, the king's daughter had become weak and powerless. When she tried to remount her horse, Falada, the chambermaid said, 'I belong to Falada, and you belong to my horse,' and the king's daughter had to submit to this. The chambermaid then ordered her to remove the royal clothes and put on her own, and finally, the king's daughter had to swear an oath under penalty of death that she would not speak a word about what had happened at the royal court. But Falada had seen everything and was on her guard.

The chambermaid then mounted Falada, and the king's daughter was forced to ride on the other horse, and they rode on until they finally arrived at the royal castle. There was great joy over their arrival, and the king's son rushed out to greet them, lifted the chambermaid off Falada, and said she was his bride, and she was led upstairs, while the true king's daughter was forced to stay below. The old king looked out of the window and saw her standing in the courtyard, and he was struck by her beauty, her youth, and her loveliness. He went immediately into the royal chambers and asked the bride who the girl was who was standing in the courtyard, and who she was. 'I picked her up on the road as a companion, give her some work to do, so that she does not stand idle.' But the old king did not know what to do with her, and all he could say was, 'I have a young boy who tends the geese, she can help him.' The boy's name was Kürdchen, and the true king's daughter was forced to help him tend the geese.

But the false bride soon spoke up to the young king, 'Dear husband, do me a favor.' 'I will do it gladly,' he replied. 'Now, summon the executioner and have the head of the horse I rode on cut off, because it has annoyed me on the way.' In reality, she was afraid that the horse might speak out against her, just as she had treated the king's daughter. It had come to this point that the horse was to be killed, and the true king's daughter heard about it, and she secretly promised the executioner a reward, which she would pay him when he did her a small service. In the city, there was a large and dark gate, where she had to take the geese through in the evenings and mornings, 'Under the dark gate, have the head of Falada nailed up, so that I can see it again and again.' The executioner agreed to do this, cut off the horse's head, and nailed it under the dark gate.

The next morning, as they were driving the geese out under the dark gate, the false bride said,

'O Falada, hanging there,'

and the head replied,

'O you, King's maiden, as you pass by,
if your mother knew,
her heart would break in two.'

The false bride walked on in silence, and they drove the geese out into the fields. When they arrived at the meadow, she sat down and began to comb her hair, which was as golden as gold, and Kürdchen looked at her and was delighted by her beauty, and wanted to grab a few of her hair strands. She said,

'Oh, oh, wind, take Kürdchen's hat,
and let him chase after it,
until I have combed and braided,
and put my hair in order again.'

And a strong wind came, and took Kürdchen's hat away, and he had to chase after it. By the time he returned, she had finished combing and braiding her hair, and he couldn't get any of her hair strands. Kürdchen was angry and didn't speak to her, and they tended the geese until it was time to go home.

The next morning, as they drove the geese out under the dark gate, the false bride said,

'O Falada, hanging there,'

and the head replied,

'O you, King's maiden, as you pass by,
if your mother knew,
her heart would break in two.'

And in the meadow, she sat down and began to comb her hair, and Kürdchen ran to grab some of her hair strands, but she quickly said,

'Oh, oh, wind, take Kürdchen's hat,
and let him chase after it,
until I have combed and braided,
and put my hair in order again.'

And a strong wind came, and took Kürdchen's hat away, and he had to chase after it, and when he returned, she had already finished combing and braiding her hair, and he couldn't get any of her hair strands. They tended the geese until it was time to go home.

In the evening, after they had returned home, Kürdchen went to the old king and said, 'I don't want to tend the geese with this girl anymore.' 'Why not?' asked the old king. 'She annoys me all day.' The old king asked him to tell him why he was so annoyed, and Kürdchen said, 'Every morning, when we drive the geese out under the dark gate, she speaks to the horse's head, "Falada, hanging there," and the head replies, "O you, King's maiden, as you pass by, if your mother knew, her heart would break in two." And then she sits down in the meadow and begins to comb her hair, and I have to chase after my hat, which the wind takes away.' The old king ordered him to drive the geese out again the next day, and he himself hid behind the dark gate and listened as she spoke to the horse's head, and then he followed her into the meadow and hid in a bush. He saw with his own eyes how the goose girl and Kürdchen drove the geese, and how she sat down and began to comb her hair, which shone like gold. He heard her say again,

'Oh, oh, wind, take Kürdchen's hat,
and let him chase after it,
until I have combed and braided,
and put my hair in order again.'

And a strong wind came, and took Kürdchen's hat away, and he had to chase after it, and the old king watched everything. He then went back home, and when the goose girl returned in the evening, he called her aside and asked her why she was behaving in such a way. 'I am not allowed to tell you, and I am not allowed to complain to anyone, for I have sworn an oath under penalty of death that I would not speak a word about what happened at the royal court.' The old king pressed her for an answer, but she refused to speak. He then said, 'If you won't tell me, then tell the iron stove, and I will listen.' And he went away. The goose girl then crept into the iron stove and began to lament and weep, and said, 'I am now forsaken by the world, and yet I am a king's daughter, and a false chambermaid has forced me to abandon my royal clothes and take on common tasks, and I have to tend the geese. If my mother knew, her heart would break in two.' The old king stood outside the stove and listened to her words, and when she finished, he came back inside and told her to come out of the stove. She was given back her royal clothes, and she was as beautiful as ever. The old king then called his son and revealed to him that the false bride was not the true one, but a chambermaid, and the true one was the girl who had been tending the geese. The young king was overjoyed when he saw her beauty and her good character, and a great feast was held, to which all the people and good friends were invited. The bridegroom sat at the head of the table, the true king's daughter on one side, and the false bride on the other, but the false bride was blinded and did not recognize the true one in her radiant beauty. After they had eaten and drunk, and were in good spirits, the old king gave the false bride a riddle, which was, 'What is a woman worth, who has betrayed her lord in such a way?' He told her the whole story and asked, 'What judgment is she worthy of?' The false bride replied, 'She is worth nothing more than to be stripped naked and put into a barrel that is studded with sharp nails, and two white horses must be harnessed to it, and it must be driven through the streets to death.' 'That is you,' said the old king, 'and you have found your own judgment, and it will be carried out.' And when the judgment was carried out, the young king married his true bride, and both of them ruled their kingdom in peace and happiness. The true king's daughter lived with the king and his wife in love and harmony, and the false bride died in her misery.
