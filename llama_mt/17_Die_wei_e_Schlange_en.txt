It has been a long time since a king lived, whose wisdom was renowned throughout the land. Nothing was unknown to him, and it was as if he was informed of the most hidden things by the air itself. However, he had a strange custom. Every day, at noon, when the table had been cleared and no one was present, a trusted servant had to bring a bowl. It was covered, and the servant himself did not know what was in it, nor did anyone else, for the king did not uncover it or eat from it until he was alone. This had been going on for a long time, when one day the servant, who was carrying the bowl away, was overcome with curiosity and could not resist, but brought the bowl to his room. When he had carefully closed the door, he lifted the lid and saw that a white snake was inside. At the sight of it, he could not resist the desire to taste it; he cut off a piece of it and put it in his mouth. As soon as it had touched his tongue, he heard a strange whispering outside his window, which sounded like the voices of fine voices. He went to listen, and he realized that it was the sparrows, who were speaking to each other and telling each other what they had seen in the field and forest. The taste of the snake had given him the ability to understand the language of animals.

Now, it so happened that on the very same day, the queen's most beautiful ring had gone missing, and suspicion fell on the trusted servant, who had access to everywhere. The king summoned him and threatened him with harsh words, saying that if he did not reveal the thief by tomorrow, he would be considered guilty and punished. It made no difference that he swore his innocence; he was not given a better answer. In his anxiety and fear, he went down to the courtyard and thought about how he could help himself out of his trouble. There, the ducks were sitting by a flowing water, peacefully beside each other, preening themselves with their beaks and having a confidential conversation. The servant stood still and listened to them. They told each other where they had been that morning, and what good food they had found, and one of them said with a sigh, "I have a heavy feeling in my stomach, I swallowed a ring that was under the queen's window in my haste." The servant immediately grabbed her by the neck, took her to the kitchen, and told the cook, "Slaughter this one, she's well-fed." "Yes," said the cook, and weighed her in his hand, "she's not been sparing in her eating, and has been waiting a long time to be roasted." He cut off her neck, and when she was eviscerated, they found the queen's ring in her stomach. The servant could now easily prove his innocence to the king, and since the king wanted to make amends for his mistake, he allowed the servant to ask for a favor and promised him the highest honor at his court.

The servant refused all the honors and asked only for a horse and travel money, because he wanted to see the world and spend some time traveling. When his request was granted, he set out on his journey and, one day, came across a pond where he saw three fish trapped in a reed and gasping for water. Although it is said that fish are mute, he could hear their complaint that they were about to die a miserable death. Because he had a compassionate heart, he dismounted his horse and set the three fish back into the water. They splashed with joy, poked their heads out of the water, and called out to him, "We will remember you and repay you for saving us." He rode on, and after a while, he heard a voice in the sand beneath his feet. He listened and heard the king of the ants complaining, "If only humans would leave us alone with the clumsy animals, then we wouldn't have to worry about being trampled by their heavy feet!" He turned onto a side path and the king of the ants called out to him, "We will remember you and repay you." The path led him into a forest, and there he saw a father raven and a mother raven, who were standing beside their nest and pushing their young out. "Get out of here, you little wretches," they cried, "we can't feed you anymore, you're big enough to feed yourselves." The poor young birds lay on the ground, flapping their wings and crying, "We helpless children, we're supposed to feed ourselves and can't even fly yet! What choice do we have but to die of hunger here?" The good young man dismounted his horse, killed it with his sword, and left it for the young ravens to eat. They came hopping over, satisfied themselves, and called out, "We will remember you and repay you."

He had to use his own legs now, and after a long time walking, he came to a large city. There was great commotion and congestion in the streets, and someone came riding by, announcing, "The princess is looking for a husband, but whoever wants to compete for her must complete a difficult task, and if he fails, he will have lost his life." Many had already tried, but in vain, risking their lives. The young man, when he saw the princess, was so blinded by her great beauty that he forgot all danger and went to the king and offered himself as a suitor.

The king immediately took him out to the sea and threw a golden ring into the water. Then he told the young man to retrieve the ring from the sea floor and added, "If you don't bring it back up without it, you'll be thrown back down into the waves until you drown." Everyone pitied the handsome young man and left him alone by the sea. He stood at the shore and thought about what he should do, when he saw three fish swimming towards him, and they were none other than the ones he had saved from death. The middle fish held a mussel in its mouth, which it dropped at the young man's feet. When he picked it up and opened it, the golden ring was inside. Overjoyed, he brought it back to the king and expected to be rewarded. But the proud princess, when she heard that he was not worthy of her, rejected him and demanded that he complete a second task. She went down into the garden and scattered ten sacks of oats into the grass. "He must gather them up by morning, before the sun rises, and not leave a single grain behind," she said. The young man sat in the garden and thought about how he could possibly complete the task, but he couldn't think of anything, and sat there sadly, expecting to be led to his death at dawn. But when the first sunbeams fell into the garden, he saw that the ten sacks were all full and well-stocked, with not a single grain missing. The king of the ants had arrived with his thousands and thousands of ants in the night, and the grateful animals had worked tirelessly to gather the oats and put them into the sacks. The princess came down into the garden and saw with wonder that the young man had completed the task that had been assigned to him. But she could not yet bring herself to overcome her pride and said, "Even if he has completed both tasks, he will not become my husband until he brings me an apple from the Tree of Life." The young man did not know where the Tree of Life was, and he set out on his journey, determined to go as far as his legs would take him, but he had no hope of finding it. After traveling through three kingdoms, he came to a forest in the evening and sat down under a tree to rest. As he was about to fall asleep, he heard a rustling in the branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time, three ravens flew down to him, settled on his knees, and said, "We are the three young ravens you saved from death; when we grew up and heard that you were searching for the golden apple, we flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life stands, and brought the apple for you." Overjoyed, the young man set out on the return journey and brought the golden apple to the princess, who now had no excuse. They shared the apple of life and ate it together, and their hearts were filled with love for each other. They lived out their lives in happy tranquility, and the king and queen thanked the young man for saving their daughter.
