Once upon a time there was a small, sweet girl, whom everyone loved who looked at her, but most of all her grandmother, who did not know what to give the child. One day she gave her a cap made of red velvet, and because it suited her so well and she wanted to wear nothing else, they called her Little Red Cap. One day her mother said to her, 'Come, Little Red Cap, here is a piece of cake and a flask of wine, take it to your grandmother, she is sick and weak and will be nourished by it. Make haste before it gets hot, and when you come back, be well-behaved and don't stray from the path, or you will fall and break the glass and your grandmother will have nothing.' And when you enter her room, don't forget to say good morning and don't look around everywhere first.'

'I'll do everything right,' said Little Red Cap to her mother, and she gave her hand on it. But the grandmother lived outside in the forest, a half-hour from the village. When Little Red Cap entered the forest, she met the wolf. But Little Red Cap did not know what kind of wicked beast this was, and she was not afraid of him. 'Good day, Little Red Cap,' said he. 'Thank you, wolf.' 'Where are you going so early, Little Red Cap?' 'To my grandmother.' 'What are you carrying under your apron?' 'Cake and wine: we baked yesterday, so the sick and weak grandmother can have something to eat and be strengthened.'

Little Red Cap, the wolf thought to himself, 'this young, delicate thing is a fat morsel, it will taste even better than the old one: you must be cunning and start by catching it, so that you can catch both of them.' So he went a little way alongside Little Red Cap, then he said, 'Little Red Cap, look at the beautiful flowers that surround us, why don't you look around? I think you're not even listening to the birds singing so sweetly? You're walking as if you were going to school, and it's so pleasant outside in the forest.'

Little Red Cap looked up, and when she saw how the sunbeams danced through the trees and everything was full of beautiful flowers, she thought, 'if I bring my grandmother a fresh bouquet, that will make her happy; it's still so early in the day that I'll arrive in time.' She left the path and went into the forest, looking for flowers. And when she broke one, she thought, 'there's a more beautiful one over there,' and she ran after it, and went deeper and deeper into the forest. The wolf, however, went straight to the grandmother's house and knocked on the door. 'Who is there?' 'Little Red Cap, she's bringing cake and wine, open up.' 'Just push the latch,' said the grandmother, 'I'm too weak to get up.' The wolf pushed the latch, the door sprang open, and he went straight to the grandmother's bed and swallowed her. Then he put on her clothes, put on her cap, got into her bed, and drew the curtains.

Little Red Cap, however, had run around looking for flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she couldn't carry them all, she remembered her grandmother and set off to visit her. She was surprised that the door opened by itself, and when she entered the room, she felt a strange atmosphere, and she thought, 'oh dear, I'm getting nervous today, and I'm usually so fond of visiting my grandmother!' She called out, 'good morning!' but received no answer. Then she went to the bed and pulled back the curtains: there lay the grandmother, with her cap pulled down over her face and looking strange. 'Oh, grandmother, what big ears you have!' 'So that I can hear better.' 'Oh, grandmother, what big eyes you have!' 'So that I can see better.' 'Oh, grandmother, what big hands you have!' 'So that I can hold you better.' 'But, grandmother, what an enormous mouth you have!' 'So that I can eat you better.' As soon as the wolf said this, he jumped out of the bed and swallowed Little Red Cap.

When the wolf had satisfied his hunger, he lay down in bed again, fell asleep, and began to snore loudly. The hunter was walking by the house and thought, 'how the old woman is snoring, you must see if she's alright.' So he entered the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw the wolf lying there. 'I've found you here, you old sinner,' he said, 'I've been looking for you for a long time.' Now he wanted to load his gun, but then he thought, 'the wolf might have eaten the grandmother, and she might still be saved.' So he didn't shoot, but took a scythe and began to cut open the wolf's belly. When he had made a few cuts, he saw the red cap shining, and a few more cuts, and out came Little Red Cap, crying, 'oh, how I was frightened, how dark it was in the wolf's belly!' And then the old grandmother came out alive too, but she could hardly breathe. Little Red Cap quickly fetched large stones, and they filled the wolf's belly with them. When the wolf woke up, he wanted to jump up, but the stones were too heavy, and he fell to the ground and died.

All three were happy: the hunter took off the wolf's skin and went home with it, the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine that Little Red Cap had brought, and she recovered, and Little Red Cap thought, 'you'll never again stray from the path and into the forest, if your mother has forbidden it.'

It is also told that once, when Little Red Cap was bringing her grandmother baked goods again, another wolf approached her and tried to lure her off the path. But Little Red Cap was cautious and went straight on her way, saying to her grandmother, 'I met a wolf who said good day to me, but looked at me with such evil eyes that if it hadn't been on the open road, he would have eaten me.' 'Come,' said the grandmother, 'we'll lock the door so that he can't get in.' Soon after, the wolf knocked on the door and said, 'open up, grandmother, I'm Little Red Cap, I'm bringing you baked goods.' But they remained silent and didn't open the door: then the wolf crept around the house several times, jumped onto the roof, and wanted to wait until Little Red Cap came home in the evening, then he would sneak up on her and eat her in the dark. But the grandmother noticed what he was planning. Now, there was a large stone trough in front of the house, and she said to Little Red Cap, 'take the bucket, Little Red Cap, I cooked sausages yesterday, take the water in which they were cooked and pour it into the trough.' Little Red Cap poured until the large trough was full. Then the smell of the sausages wafted up to the wolf's nose, he sniffed and looked down, finally he stretched his neck so far that he couldn't hold himself up any more, and began to slide: so he slid from the roof down into the large trough and drowned. Little Red Cap, however, went happily home, and no one did her any harm.
