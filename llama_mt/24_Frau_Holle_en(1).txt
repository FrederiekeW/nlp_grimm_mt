There was a widow who had two daughters, one of whom was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The widow, however, loved the ugly and lazy one more because she was her own daughter, and the other had to do all the work and be the Cinderella of the house. The poor girl had to sit every day on the big street by a well and spin so much that the blood would spring from her fingers. One time, the spindle was so bloody that she bent down to wash it in the well, but it slipped from her hand and fell in. She cried, ran to the stepmother, and told her the misfortune. But the stepmother scolded her so harshly and was so merciless that she said, “If you let the spindle fall in, then go fetch it again.” The girl went back to the well, didn’t know what to do, and in her heart’s anguish jumped into the well to fetch the spindle. She lost consciousness, and when she came to and regained her senses, she found herself on a beautiful meadow where the sun was shining and thousands of flowers stood. She walked on this meadow and came to an oven, which was full of bread. The bread cried out, “Ah, pull me out, pull me out, or I will burn; I am already baked long enough.” She approached and pulled out the bread with the peel, one piece after the other. Then she continued on and came to an apple tree, which was full of apples, and cried out to her, “Ah, shake me, shake me; all the apples are ripe together.” She shook the tree so hard that the apples fell like rain, and she shook until none were left on top. Then she picked them all up in a heap and continued on. Finally, she came to a small house, from which an old woman looked out. But because she had such big teeth, the girl was afraid and wanted to run away. The old woman, however, called out to her, “What are you afraid of, dear child? Stay with me if you want to do all the work in the house properly, and you will be well off. You just have to make sure that you make my bed well and shake it vigorously so that the feathers fly, then it will snow in the world.” Because the old woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl took heart and agreed to stay with her and do her work. She took care of everything to her satisfaction, and shook her bed so vigorously that the feathers flew around like snowflakes. For this, she had a good life with her, no bad words, and every day she had roasted and boiled food. But after a time, she became sad and didn’t know what was wrong with her. Finally, she realized that she had homesickness. Even though she had it much better here than at home, she had a longing to be there. She said to the old woman, “I have caught the misery of home, and even though I have it so good here below, I cannot stay here any longer; I must go back to my people.” The old woman said, “I like that you want to go back home, and because you have served me so faithfully, I will take you back myself.” She took her by the hand and led her to a large gate. The gate was opened, and when the girl stood right under it, a great rain of gold fell, and all the gold stuck to her, so that she was covered in it from head to toe. “This is what you deserve for being so industrious,” said the old woman and gave her back the spindle that had fallen into the well. Then the gate was closed, and the girl found herself back on earth, not far from her mother’s house. When she came into the courtyard, the rooster on the well cried out, “Kikeriki! Our golden girl is back home.” The girl went inside to her mother, and because she was covered in gold, she was welcomed back by her and her sister. The girl told her mother everything that had happened to her, and when her mother heard how she had become so rich, she wanted to give the same good fortune to her other ugly and lazy daughter. She had to sit by the well and spin, and when her spindle became bloody, she stuck herself with it and threw the spindle into the well and jumped in after it. She came, like the other, to the beautiful meadow and followed the same path. When she came to the oven, the bread cried out, “Ah, pull me out, pull me out, or I will burn; I am already baked long enough.” But the lazy girl replied, “I would like to get dirty,” and continued on. Soon she came to the apple tree, which cried out, “Ah, shake me, shake me; all the apples are ripe together.” She replied, “You are just right, one of them could fall on my head,” and continued on. When she came to the old woman’s house, she was not afraid because she had heard about her big teeth, and she hired herself out to her right away. On the first day, she tried to be industrious, followed the old woman, and did what she was told, thinking about the gold she would receive. But on the second day, she began to slack off, and on the third day, she didn’t want to get up in the morning. She also didn’t make the old woman’s bed properly and didn’t shake it so that the feathers flew. The old woman soon grew tired of her and said, “You can leave my service.” The lazy girl was happy with that and thought that the gold rain would come now. The old woman took her to the gate, and when she stood under it, a great kettle full of pitch was poured out instead of gold. “This is your reward for your services,” said the old woman and closed the gate. When the lazy girl came home, she was covered in pitch and the rooster on the well cried out, “Kikeriki! Our dirty girl is back home.” The pitch stuck to her and wouldn’t come off as long as she lived.
