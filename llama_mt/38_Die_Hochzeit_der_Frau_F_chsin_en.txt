First Story.
Once upon a time there was an old fox with nine tails who thought his wife was not faithful to him and wanted to test her. He lay down under the bench, did not stir a limb, and pretended to be dead. The fox wife went to her chamber, locked herself in, and her maid, the young cat, sat on the hearth and cooked. As soon as it was known that the old fox had died, the suitors came. The maid heard that someone was standing at the front door and knocking; she went and opened it, and there was a young fox who said

‘What are you doing, young cat?
Are you sleeping or waking?’

She replied

‘I am not sleeping, I am waking.
Do you want to know what I am doing?
I am brewing warm beer, putting butter in it:
do you want to be my guest?’

‘I thank you, young cat,’ said the fox, ‘what is the fox wife doing?’ The maid replied

‘She is sitting in her chamber,
she is lamenting her sorrow,
she is crying her eyes red,
because the old Mr. Fox is dead.’

‘Tell her that a young fox is there who wants to court her.’ ‘All right, young sir.’

Then the cat ran up the stairs, then the door slammed shut. ‘Mrs. Fox, are you there?’ ‘Ah yes, my kitten, yes.’ ‘There is a suitor out there.’ ‘My child, how does he look like?’ ‘Has he got nine beautiful tails like the late Mr. Fox?’ ‘No’ replied the cat, ‘he has only one.’ ‘So I won’t have him.’

The young cat went down and sent the suitor away. Soon afterwards, someone knocked at the door again, and it was another fox who wanted to court the fox wife; he had two tails, but it didn’t go any better for him. Then others came one after another with one tail more, but they were all rejected until finally one came who had nine tails like the old Mr. Fox. When the widow heard this, she said to the cat with joy

‘Now open the door and let the old Mr. Fox out.’

But just as the wedding was to be celebrated, the old Mr. Fox stirred under the bench, beat the whole gang and chased them out of the house with the fox wife.

Second Story.
When the old Mr. Fox had died, the wolf came as a suitor, knocked at the door, and the cat, who served as a maid to the fox wife, opened it. The wolf greeted her and said

‘Good day, Mrs. Cat of Kehrewitz,
why are you sitting alone?
What are you doing good?’

The cat replied

‘I am milking a cow and pouring milk into a bowl:
do you want to be my guest?’

‘Thank you, Mrs. Cat,’ replied the wolf, ‘the fox wife not at home?’ The cat said

‘She is sitting in the chamber upstairs,
crying her sorrow,
crying her great distress,
because the old Mr. Fox is dead.’

The wolf replied

‘If she wants to have another husband,
she should only come down.’
The cat ran up the stairs and let her tail go rumbling until she came to the long hall: she knocked with her five golden rings.
‘Mrs. Fox, is she inside?
If she wants to have another husband,
she should only come down.’

The fox wife asked ‘does the gentleman have red breeches on and has he a pointed snout?’ ‘No’ replied the cat. ‘So he can’t serve me.’

When the wolf was rejected, a dog, a deer, a hare, a bear, a lion, and all the other forest animals came one after another. But each time there was something missing from the good qualities the old Mr. Fox had, and the cat had to send the suitor away. Finally, a young fox came. Then the fox wife said ‘does the gentleman have red breeches on and has he a pointed snout?’ ‘Yes’ said the cat, ‘he has.’ ‘So let him come up’ said the fox wife, and ordered her maid to prepare the wedding feast.

‘Cat, clean the room,
and throw the old fox out the window.
He used to eat all the mice alone,
but never gave me any.’

Then the wedding was celebrated with the young Mr. Fox, and there was jubilation and dancing, and if they hadn’t stopped, they would still be dancing today.
