There once was a poor farmer named Krebs, who drove two oxen loaded with a fagot of wood into the city and sold it to a doctor for two thalers. When the doctor paid him, the doctor was sitting at table and Krebs saw how he ate and drank beautifully, and his heart went out to him and he would have liked to be a doctor himself. So he stood there for a bit longer and finally asked if he couldn’t become a doctor too. ‘Oh yes,’ said the doctor, ‘that will happen soon.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the farmer. ‘Firstly, buy yourself a book, one with a rooster on it; secondly, sell your cart and oxen and get yourself some clothes and whatever else is needed for a doctor; thirdly, have a sign painted with the words ‘I am the all-knowing doctor’ and hang it above your front door.’ The farmer did everything he was told to do. When he had done a bit of doctoring, but not much, a rich nobleman had some money stolen from him. The nobleman was told that the all-knowing doctor lived in such and such a village and must know where the money had gone. So the nobleman had his carriage harnessed and drove out to the village and asked if the all-knowing doctor was there. ‘Yes, that’s him.’ ‘Then he should come along and help us find the stolen money.’ ‘Oh yes, but his wife, Grethe, must come along too.’ The nobleman was satisfied with this and had them both get into the carriage, and they drove on together. When they arrived at the nobleman’s estate, the table was set and he was invited to eat first. ‘But his wife, Grethe, too,’ said the doctor, and he sat down with her behind the table. When the first servant came in with a dish of beautiful food, the farmer nudged his wife and said ‘Grethe, that’s the first one’, meaning that it was the first servant to bring food. But the servant thought he meant that it was the first thief, and because he was indeed the first thief, he was frightened and said to his fellow servants outside ‘the doctor knows everything, we’re in trouble: he said I was the first one.’ The second servant was reluctant to come in, but he had to. When he came in with his dish, the farmer nudged his wife again and said ‘Grethe, that’s the second one’. The servant was frightened again and quickly got out. The third servant didn’t fare any better, the farmer said again ‘Grethe, that’s the third one’. The fourth servant had to bring in a covered dish, and the nobleman asked the doctor to show his skill and guess what was inside. It was a plate of crabs. The farmer looked at the dish and didn’t know what to do and said ‘oh, I’m a poor Krebs!’ When the nobleman heard this, he exclaimed ‘ah, he knows it, now he knows who stole the money too!’ The servant was terrified and looked at the doctor and wanted to get out. When he finally got out, all four servants confessed that they had stolen the money and wanted to give the doctor a large sum of money if he wouldn’t tell on them, otherwise they would be in big trouble. They took him to where the money was hidden. The doctor was satisfied and went back in, sat down at the table and said ‘nobleman, now I will look in my book to see where the money is.’ The fifth servant crawled into the oven to see if the doctor knew anything else. The doctor sat and opened his book, leafed through it and searched for the rooster. Because he couldn’t find it right away, he said ‘you’re in there and you must come out too.’ The servant in the oven thought he was meant and sprang out in fright, shouting ‘the man knows everything!’ The doctor then showed the nobleman where the money was hidden, but didn’t reveal who had stolen it, and was rewarded with a large sum of money from both sides and became a famous man.
