The Fox came upon a meadow where a flock of beautiful fat geese were sitting, then he laughed and said, “I come just in time, you sit so nicely together, so I can eat one after the other.” The geese gawked in terror, sprang up, began to wail and pitifully begged for their lives. The Fox, however, would not listen and said, “There is no mercy, you must die.” At last one of them took heart and said, “Should we poor geese not be allowed to spare our young fresh lives, so show us the only mercy and allow us to pray, so that we do not die in our sins: afterwards we will also stand in line, so you can always choose the fattest one.” “Yes,” said the Fox, “that is reasonable, and is a pious request: pray, I will wait.” So the first one began a long prayer, always “ga! ga!” and because she did not stop, the second one did not wait until it was her turn, but also began “ga! ga!” The third and fourth followed her, and soon they were all gawking together. (And if they have finished praying, the story will be continued, but they are still praying for now.)
