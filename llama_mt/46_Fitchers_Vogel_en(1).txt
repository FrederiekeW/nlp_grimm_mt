Once upon a time there was a sorcerer who took the form of a poor man, went from house to house begging, and lured beautiful maidens. No one knew where he took them, as they never reappeared. One day he appeared before the door of a man who had three beautiful daughters, looked like a poor, weak beggar, and carried a sack on his back as if he wanted to collect alms. He asked for a bit of food, and when the eldest came out and offered him a piece of bread, he only touched her and she had to jump into his sack. Thereupon he hurried away with strong strides and carried her to a dark forest to his house, which stood in the middle of it. In the house everything was grand: he gave her everything she wanted and said, “My dear, you will enjoy yourself with me, you have everything your heart desires.” This lasted for a few days, when he said, “I must travel and leave you alone for a short time, there are the house keys, you can go everywhere and look at everything, but not into a room that this small key opens, that I forbid you at the risk of your life.” He also gave her an egg and said, “Keep the egg carefully and carry it with you always, for if it is lost, a great misfortune will arise.” She took the keys and the egg and promised to manage everything well. When he was gone, she went through the house from top to bottom and looked at everything, the rooms shone with silver and gold, and she thought she had never seen such great splendor. Finally, she came to the forbidden door, she wanted to pass by, but curiosity did not let her rest. She looked at the key, it looked like another, she put it in and turned it a little, and the door opened. But what did she see when she went in? A large bloody basin stood in the middle, and in it lay dead, hacked-up people, next to it stood a wooden block and a shining axe lay on it. She was so frightened that the egg she held in her hand fell in. She took it out and wiped the blood off, but in vain, it reappeared; she wiped and scraped, but she couldn’t get it off.
Not long after, the man returned from his journey, and the first thing he demanded was the key and the egg. She handed it to him, but she trembled, and he saw the red spots on it and knew she had been in the bloody chamber. “Have you gone against my will into the chamber?” he said, “then you shall go against your will again. Your life is at an end.” He threw her down, dragged her by the hair, struck her head on the block, and hacked her up, so that her blood flowed on the floor. Then he threw her with the others into the basin.
“Now I will get the second one,” said the sorcerer, went again in the form of a poor man to the house and begged. The second one brought him a piece of bread, he caught her like the first one by just touching her and carried her away. It did not go any better for her than for her sister, she was tempted by her curiosity, opened the bloody chamber and looked in, and had to pay with her life when he returned. He then went and got the third one, but she was clever and cunning. When he had given her the keys and the egg and left, she first carefully kept the egg, then looked at the house and finally went to the forbidden chamber. Oh, what did she see! Her two beloved sisters lay in the basin, brutally murdered and hacked up. But she began and gathered the limbs together and arranged them properly, head, body, arms, and legs. And when nothing was missing, the limbs began to move and join together, and both girls opened their eyes and were alive again. They were overjoyed, kissed and hugged each other. When the man returned, he immediately demanded the key and the egg, and when he could not find any trace of blood on it, he said, “You have passed the test, you shall be my bride.” He had no power over her anymore and had to do what she wanted. “Well,” she replied, “you must first bring a basket full of gold to my father and mother and carry it yourself on your back; in the meantime, I will arrange the wedding.” Then she went to her sisters, who she had hidden in a small room and said, “The moment has come when I can rescue you: the wicked man will bring you home himself, but as soon as you are home, send help.” She put both in a basket and covered them with gold so that nothing was visible, then she called the sorcerer in and said, “Now take the basket away, but don’t stop and rest on the way, I’m watching from my window and have my eyes on you.” The sorcerer lifted the basket onto his back and went away, but he pressed it so hard that sweat dripped from his face. He wanted to rest, but immediately a voice from the basket called out, “I’m looking out of my window and see that you’re resting, do you want to go on?” He thought it was his bride who was calling and got up again. He wanted to rest again, but it called out again, “I’m looking out of my window and see that you’re resting, do you want to go on?” And so every time he stopped, it called out, and he had to go on until he finally, groaning and exhausted, brought the basket with gold and the two girls to their parents’ house. At home, the bride arranged the wedding and invited the friends of the sorcerer. Then she took a skull with grinning teeth, put a decoration on it, and a flower wreath, and carried it up to the window and let it look out. When everything was ready, she climbed into a barrel of honey, cut the bed, and rolled around in it so that she looked like a strange bird and no one could recognize her. Then she went out of the house and, on her way, met some of the wedding guests who asked, “You, Fitcher’s Bird, where are you from?” “I come from Fitcher’s house,” she replied. “What is the young bride doing?” “She has turned the house upside down from top to bottom and is looking out of the window.” Finally, she met the bridegroom, who was walking slowly back. He asked the same question as the others, “You, Fitcher’s Bird, where are you from?” “I come from Fitcher’s house,” she replied. “What is my young bride doing?” “She has turned the house upside down from top to bottom and is looking out of the window.” The bridegroom looked up and saw the decorated skull, and thought it was his bride and nodded to it and greeted it kindly. As he and his guests entered the house, the brothers and relatives of the bride arrived, who had been sent to her rescue. They locked all the doors of the house so that no one could escape and set fire to it, so that the sorcerer and his gang had to burn. Then the Fitcher Bird came out, who had been in the barrel of honey, and sang with a loud voice, “Fitcher Bird, Fitcher Bird, sit on your sparrow, Fitcher Bird, Fitcher Bird, listen, listen, listen!” And so she sang until the sorcerer and his gang had died under the smoke. And that was the end of the Fitcher Bird.
