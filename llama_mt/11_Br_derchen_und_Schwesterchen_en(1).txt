Brother took Sister by the hand and said, “Since Mother is dead, we have had no good hour; the stepmother beats us every day, and when we come to her, she kicks us with her feet. The hard crusts of bread that remain are our food, and the little dog under the table fares better; we sometimes give it a good bite. May God have mercy if Mother were to know! Come, let us go together into the wide world.”

They walked all day over meadows, fields, and stones, and when it rained, Sister said, “God and our hearts weep together!” In the evening, they came to a large forest and were so tired from sorrow, hunger, and the long journey that they sat in a hollow tree and fell asleep.

The next morning, when they woke up, the sun was already high in the sky and shone hot into the tree. Brother said, “Sister, I am thirsty; if I knew a brook, I would go and drink once; I think I hear one babbling.” Brother stood up, took Sister by the hand, and they wanted to search for the brook. The wicked stepmother, however, was a witch and had seen how the two children had gone, had followed them secretly, like witches do, and had cursed all the wells in the forest. When they found a brook that sparkled over the stones, Brother wanted to drink from it, but Sister heard how it spoke in the babbling sound, “Whoever drinks from me will become a tiger; whoever drinks from me will become a tiger.” Sister said, “I beg of you, Brother, do not drink, otherwise you will become a wild animal and tear me apart.” Brother did not drink, although he had a great thirst, and said, “I will wait until we come to the next well.”

When they came to the second well, Sister heard how it spoke in the babbling sound, “Whoever drinks from me will become a wolf; whoever drinks from me will become a wolf.” Sister said, “Brother, I beg of you, do not drink, otherwise you will become a wolf and devour me.” Brother did not drink and said, “I will wait until we come to the next well, but then I must drink, you can say what you want; my thirst is too great.” And when they came to the third well, Sister heard how it spoke in the babbling sound, “Whoever drinks from me will become a deer; whoever drinks from me will become a deer.” Sister said, “Ah, Brother, I beg of you, do not drink, otherwise you will become a deer and run away from me.” But Brother had already knelt down at the well, bent down, and drunk from the water, and as the first drops came onto his lips, he lay there as a fawn.

Now Sister wept over the poor, cursed Brother, and the fawn wept too and sat sorrowfully beside him. Sister finally said, “Be quiet, dear fawn, I will never leave you again.” Then she untied her golden garter and put it around the fawn’s neck, and pulled some reeds and wove a soft cord from them. She tied the little creature to it and led it further, and went deeper into the forest. And when they had walked for a long time, they finally came to a small house, and Sister looked inside, and because it was empty, she thought, “Here we can stay and live.” So she searched for leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the fawn, and every morning she went out and gathered roots, berries, and nuts, and brought tender grass for the fawn to eat, which it ate from her hand, was happy and played around her. In the evening, when Sister was tired and had said her prayer, she laid her head on the fawn’s back, which was her pillow, and fell asleep softly.

And if only Brother had had his human form, it would have been a wonderful life.

This went on for a while, that they were alone in the wilderness. But it happened that the king of the land held a great hunt in the forest. Then the horn-blowing, barking of dogs, and the joyful shouting of the hunters resounded through the trees, and the fawn heard it and would have loved to be part of it. “Ah,” it said to Sister, “let me go out into the hunt, I can no longer bear it,” and begged until she agreed. “But,” she said to him, “come back to me tonight before the wild hunters, I will close my little door; and so you can know me, speak my name, Sister, and let me in: and if you do not speak my name, I will not open my door.” Now the fawn sprang out, and was happy and carefree in the open air. The king and his hunters saw the beautiful creature and pursued it, but they could not catch it, and whenever they thought they had it, the fawn would leap over the bushes and disappear. When it grew dark, it ran to the little house, knocked, and said, “Sister, let me in.” Then the door was opened to it, and it sprang in and rested the whole night on its soft bed.

The next morning, the hunt began again, and when the fawn heard the horn-blowing and the loud “Ho! Ho!” of the hunters, it had no peace and said, “Sister, open the door for me, I must go out.” Sister opened the door for it and said, “But you must be back tonight and say your little phrase.” When the king and his hunters saw the fawn with the golden collar again, they chased it, but it was too quick and agile. This went on all day, and finally, the hunters surrounded it in the evening, and one of them wounded it a little on the foot, so that it had to limp and move slowly. Then a hunter crept up to it until it came to the little house and heard it say, “Sister, let me in,” and saw that the door was opened and then closed again quickly. The hunter remembered this and went to the king and told him what he had seen and heard. The king said, “Tomorrow we will hunt again.”

But Sister was terribly frightened when she saw that her fawn was wounded. She washed its blood, put herbs on it, and said, “Go to your bed, dear fawn, so that you can heal again.” The wound, however, was so small that the fawn felt nothing from it the next morning. And when it heard the hunting cry again, it said, “I can no longer bear it, I must be part of it; no one will catch me soon.” Sister wept and said, “Now they will kill you, and I am left alone in the forest, forsaken by the whole world: I will not let you go out.” “Then I will die of sorrow,” replied the fawn, “when I hear the horn-blowing, I will think I must jump out of my shoes!” Sister could not help herself and opened the door to it with a heavy heart, and the fawn sprang out, healthy and happy, into the forest. When the king saw it, he said to his hunters, “Now chase it all day until nightfall, but make sure no one harms it.”

As soon as the sun had set, the king said to the hunter, “Now come and show me the little house in the forest.” And when he stood before the little door, he knocked and said, “Dear Sister, let me in.” Then the door opened, and the king entered, and there stood a girl, who was as beautiful as he had never seen before. The girl was frightened when she saw that it was not her fawn, but a man with a golden crown on his head. But the king looked at her kindly, took her hand, and said, “Do you want to come with me to my castle and be my dear wife?” “Ah, yes,” she replied, “but the fawn must come too; I will not leave it behind.” The king said, “It can stay with you as long as you live, and it will have nothing to lack.” Then the fawn came running in, and Sister tied it to the cord again, took it in her hand, and went out of the little house with the king.

The king took the beautiful girl on his horse and led her to his castle, where a grand wedding was celebrated, and she was now the queen. They lived happily together for a long time; the fawn was cared for and petted and ran around in the castle garden. The wicked stepmother, however, who had driven the children into the world, thought that Sister had been torn apart by the wild animals in the forest and that Brother had been shot by the hunters as a fawn. When she heard that they were so happy and that it was going well for them, she was filled with envy and malice in her heart and could not rest, and she had only one thought, how she could still bring the two into misfortune. Her ugly daughter, who was as ugly as night and had only one eye, made accusations against her and said, “I should have been queen; I should have had that luck.” “Be quiet,” said the old woman, “when the time comes, I will be there.” When the time had come, and the queen had given birth to a beautiful little boy, and the king was out hunting, the old witch took the form of the nurse and entered the room where the queen lay and said to the weak queen, “Come, the bath is ready, it will do you good and give you fresh strength; quickly, before it gets cold.” Her daughter was also there, and they carried the weak queen to the bath and put her in the tub; then they closed the door and ran away. In the bath, however, they had set a real hellfire, and the beautiful young queen had to suffocate soon.

When this was done, the old woman took her daughter, put a cap on her head, and laid her in the bed in the queen’s place. She also gave her the queen’s appearance and demeanor, except that she could not give her back the lost eye. To prevent the king from noticing, she had to lie on the side where she had no eye. In the evening, when the king came home and heard that a little boy had been born, he was overjoyed and wanted to go to his beloved wife and see what she was doing. The old woman quickly said, “Leave the curtains closed, the queen is not allowed to see the light yet and needs rest.” The king went back and did not notice that a false queen was lying in bed.

But when it was midnight and everyone was asleep, the nurse, who was sitting in the nursery next to the cradle and was the only one still awake, saw the door open and the real queen enter. She took the child out of the cradle, laid it in her arms, gave it to drink, and kissed it. Then she laid it back in the cradle and covered it with the blanket. She did not forget the fawn either, went to the corner where it lay, and stroked it over the back. Then she went quietly out of the room and the nurse asked the guards the next morning if anyone had entered the castle during the night, but they replied, “No, we have seen no one.” So the queen came many nights and never spoke a word; the nurse saw her, but she did not dare to tell anyone.

When a time had passed, the queen began to speak in the night and said,

“What is my child doing? What is my fawn doing?
I will come two more times and then no more.”

The nurse did not answer, but when the queen had disappeared, the nurse went to the king and told him everything. The king said, “Ah, God, what is this! I will watch over the child in the next night.” In the evening, the king went to the nursery, but at midnight, the queen appeared again and said,

“What is my child doing? What is my fawn doing?
I will come one more time and then no more.”

And then she cared for the child as she usually did before she disappeared. The king did not dare to speak to her, but he also watched in the following night. She spoke again,

“What is my child doing? What is my fawn doing?
I will come one more time and then no more.”

The king could no longer restrain himself, jumped up to her, and said, “You can be no one else but my dear wife.” The queen replied, “Yes, I am your dear wife,” and in that moment, by God’s grace, she was restored to life, was fresh, rosy, and healthy. Then she told the king of the wicked deed that the old witch and her daughter had committed against her. The king had them brought before court, and judgment was pronounced. The daughter was led into the forest, where she was torn apart by the wild animals, and the witch was thrown into the fire and had to suffer a painful death. And when she was reduced to ashes, the fawn was transformed and regained its human form again; Sister and Brother lived happily together until their old age. The king loved his queen even more than before and let her live in peace and happiness.
