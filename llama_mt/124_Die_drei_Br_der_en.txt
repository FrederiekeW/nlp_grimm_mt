There was a man who had three sons and nothing else in his estate but the house he lived in. Now each of them would have liked to inherit the house after his death, but the father loved them all equally, so he didn’t know how to decide without offending any of them. He didn’t want to sell the house either, as it had been passed down from his ancestors; if he had, he would have divided the money among them. Finally, he hit upon a plan and said to his sons, ‘Go out into the world and try your luck; learn a trade, each one of you, and when you come back, whoever makes the best piece of work will get the house.’

The sons were satisfied with this proposal, and the eldest wanted to become a farrier, the second a barber, and the third a fencing master. They then agreed on a time when they would return home together and set off. It so happened that each of them found a good master to learn from, where they acquired some respectable skills. The farrier had to shoe the king’s horses and thought to himself, ‘Now it can’t go wrong; I’ll get the house.’ The barber shaved all sorts of noble gentlemen and thought the house was already his. The fencing master took a lot of blows, but bit his tongue and didn’t let it get to him, thinking to himself, ‘If you’re afraid of a blow, you’ll never get the house.’

When the agreed-upon time had passed, they returned to their father together, but they didn’t know how to find the right opportunity to show off their skills, so they sat down together and discussed it. As they sat there, a hare suddenly ran across the field. ‘Ah,’ said the barber, ‘that’s just what we need,’ took up his basin and soap, lathered up for a long time until the hare was in range, then soaped it as it ran and also shaved it a little beard, and didn’t hurt it or pull a single hair out. ‘That looks good to me,’ said the father, ‘if the others don’t make a big show of themselves, the house is yours.’ It didn’t take long before a gentleman came racing along in a carriage, in full flight. ‘Now you’ll see, father, what I can do,’ said the farrier, and ran after the carriage, pulled off the four horseshoes from the horse that was racing along, and in the same motion, hammered four new ones back on. ‘You’re a fine fellow,’ said the father, ‘you do your work just as well as your brother; I don’t know who to give the house to.’ Then the third brother said, ‘Father, let me have a turn too,’ and because it started to rain, he drew his sword and waved it in cross-stroke over his head, so that not a single drop fell on him. And when the rain got stronger and eventually poured down as if buckets were being poured from the sky, he swung his sword faster and faster and remained as dry as if he were under a roof. When the father saw this, he was amazed and said, ‘You’ve done the best piece of work; the house is yours.’

The two other brothers were satisfied with how they had been praised before, and because they loved each other so much, they all three stayed together in the house and continued their trades. As they had learned so well and were so skilled, they earned a lot of money. They lived happily together until they grew old, and when one of them fell ill and died, the other two were so grieved that they also fell ill and soon died. They were all three buried together in a grave, because they had been so skilled and loved each other so much.
